	title = {The information bottleneck method},
	month = {April},
	year = 2000,
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0004057},
	abstract = {We define the relevant information in a signal \$x\in X\$ as being the information that this signal provides about another signal \$y\in \Y\$. Examples include the information that face images provide about the names of the people portrayed, or the information that speech sounds provide about the words spoken. Understanding the signal \$x\$ requires more than just predicting \$y\$, it also requires specifying which features of \$\X\$ play a role in the prediction. We formalize this problem as that of finding a short code for \$\X\$ that preserves the maximum information about \$\Y\$. That is, we squeeze the information that \$\X\$ provides about \$\Y\$ through a `bottleneck' formed by a limited set of codewords \$\tX\$. This constrained optimization problem can be seen as a generalization of rate distortion theory in which the distortion measure \$d(x,\x)\$ emerges from the joint statistics of \$\X\$ and \$\Y\$. This approach yields an exact set of self consistent equations for the coding rules \$X \to \tX\$ and \$\tX \to \Y\$. Solutions to these equations can be found by a convergent re-estimation method that generalizes the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. Our variational principle provides a surprisingly rich framework for discussing a variety of problems in signal processing and learning, as will be described in detail elsewhere.},
