	abstract = {The activity of midbrain dopamine neurons is strikingly similar to the reward prediction error of temporal difference reinforcement learning models. Experimental evidence and simulation studies suggest that dopamine neuron activity serves as an effective reinforcement signal for learning of sensorimotor associations in striatal matrisomes. In the current study, we simulate dopamine neuron activity with the extended temporal difference model of Pavlovian learning and examine the influences of this signal on medium spiny neurons in striatal matrisomes. The modeled influences include transient membrane effects of dopamine D(1) receptor activation, dopamine-dependent long-term adaptations of corticostriatal transmission, and effects of dopamine on rhythmic fluctuations of the membrane potential between an elevated "up-state" and a hyperpolarized "down-state". The most dominant activity in the striatal matrisomes is assumed to elicit behaviors via projections from the basal ganglia to the thalamus and the cortex. This "standard model" performs successfully when tested for sensorimotor learning and goal-directed behavior (planning). To investigate the contributions of our model assumptions to learning and planning, we test the performance of several model variants that lack one of these mechanisms. These simulations show that the adaptation of the dopamine-like signal is necessary for sensorimotor learning and planning. Sensorimotor learning requires dopamine-dependent long-term adaptation of corticostriatal transmission. Lack of dopamine-like novelty responses decreases the number of exploratory acts, which impairs planning capabilities. The model loses its planning capabilities if the dopamine-like signal is simulated with the original temporal difference model, because the original temporal difference model does not form novel associative chains. Transient membrane effects of the dopamine-like signal on striatal firing substantially shorten the reaction time in the planning task. The capability for planning is improved by influences of dopamine on the durations of membrane potential fluctuations and by manipulations that prolong the reaction time of the model. These results suggest that responses of dopamine neurons to conditioned stimuli contribute to sensorimotor reward learning, novelty responses of dopamine neurons stimulate exploration, and transient dopamine membrane effects are important for planning.},

	abstract = {{The induction of associative synaptic plasticity in the mammalian central nervous system classically depends on coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. According to this principle, associative homosynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission can be induced only if synaptic release occurs during postsynaptic depolarization. In contrast, heterosynaptic plasticity in mammals is considered to rely on activity-independent, non-associative processes. Here we describe a novel mechanism underlying the induction of associative LTP in the lateral amygdala (LA). Simultaneous activation of converging cortical and thalamic afferents specifically induced associative, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor-dependent LTP at cortical, but not at thalamic, inputs. Surprisingly, the induction of associative LTP at cortical inputs was completely independent of postsynaptic activity, including depolarization, postsynaptic NMDA receptor activation or an increase in postsynaptic Ca2+ concentration, and did not require network activity. LTP expression was mediated by a persistent increase in the presynaptic probability of release at cortical afferents. Our study shows the presynaptic induction and expression of heterosynaptic and associative synaptic plasticity on simultaneous activity of converging afferents. Our data indicate that input specificity of associative LTP can be determined exclusively by presynaptic properties.}},

	abstract = {{RATIONALE: Impaired ability to shift perceptual attentional set forms a core feature of schizophrenic illness and is associated with prefrontal cortical dysfunction. A pharmacological model producing equivalent deficits in rodents may enable the development of novel therapeutic strategies for effective treatment of cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate the effects of phencyclidine (PCP) administration on performance in a rodent attentional set-shifting task and the neural correlates of PCP-induced deficits in task performance. METHODS: Twenty-four hours following acute administration of 2.58 mg/kg PCP or vehicle, rats were tested on a perceptual attentional set shifting task (Birrell and Brown in J Neurosci 20:4320-4324, 2000). Following completion of the task, in situ hybridisation was employed to detect concurrent regional alterations in zif-268 and parvalbumin mRNA expression. RESULTS: PCP administration selectively decreased the ability of rats to shift attentional set between perceptual dimensions (extra-dimensional shift, EDS). This impairment was accompanied by, and correlated with, decreases in expression of zif-286 in the infralimbic cortex and of parvalbumin in the dorsal reticular nucleus of the thalamus. CONCLUSION: Acute administration of PCP produces deficits in perceptual set shifting comparable to an aspect of executive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Moreover, this impairment is associated with altered medial prefrontal cortical and reticular thalamic activity. Therefore, this rodent paradigm may model the set-shifting deficits that form a core feature of schizophrenic pathology.}},
