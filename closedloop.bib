    abstract = {{Sensor evolution in nature aims at improving the acquisition of information from the environment and is intimately related with selection pressure toward adaptivity and robustness. Our work in the area indicates that information theory can be applied to the perception-action loop.  This letter studies the perception-action loop of agents, which is modeled as a causal Bayesian network. Finite state automata are evolved as agent controllers in a simple virtual world to maximize information flow through the perception-action loop. The information flow maximization organizes the agent's behavior as well as its information processing. To gain more insight into the results, the evolved implicit representations of space and time are analyzed in an information-theoretic manner, which paves the way toward a principled and general understanding of the mechanisms guiding the evolution of sensors in nature and provides insights into the design of mechanisms for artificial sensor evolution.}},

    abstract = {<p>Biological organisms continuously select and sample information used by their neural structures for perception and action, and for creating coherent cognitive states guiding their autonomous behavior. Information processing, however, is not solely an internal function of the nervous system. Here we show, instead, how sensorimotor interaction and body morphology can induce statistical regularities and information structure in sensory inputs and within the neural control architecture, and how the flow of information between sensors, neural units, and effectors is actively shaped by the interaction with the environment. We analyze sensory and motor data collected from real and simulated robots and reveal the presence of information structure and directed information flow induced by dynamically coupled sensorimotor activity, including effects of motor outputs on sensory inputs. We find that information structure and information flow in sensorimotor networks (a) is spatially and temporally specific; (b) can be affected by learning, and (c) can be affected by changes in body morphology. Our results suggest a fundamental link between physical embeddedness and information, highlighting the effects of embodied interactions on internal (neural) information processing, and illuminating the role of various system components on the generation of behavior.</p>},
