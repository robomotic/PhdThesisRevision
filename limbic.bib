	abstract = {{Emotions are multifaceted, but a key aspect of emotion involves the assessment of the value of environmental stimuli. This article reviews the many psychological representations, including representations of stimulus value, which are formed in the brain during Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning tasks. These representations may be related directly to the functions of cortical and subcortical neural structures. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) appears to be required for a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) to gain access to the current value of the specific unconditioned stimulus (US) that it predicts, while the central nucleus of the amygdala acts as a controller of brainstem arousal and response systems, and subserves some forms of stimulus-response Pavlovian conditioning. The nucleus accumbens, which appears not to be required for knowledge of the contingency between instrumental actions and their outcomes, nevertheless influences instrumental behaviour strongly by allowing Pavlovian CSs to affect the level of instrumental responding (Pavlovian-instrumental transfer), and is required for the normal ability of animals to choose rewards that are delayed. The prelimbic cortex is required for the detection of instrumental action-outcome contingencies, while insular cortex may allow rats to retrieve the values of specific foods via their sensory properties. The orbitofrontal cortex, like the BLA, may represent aspects of reinforcer value that govern instrumental choice behaviour. Finally, the anterior cingulate cortex, implicated in human disorders of emotion and attention, may have multiple roles in responding to the emotional significance of stimuli and to errors in performance, preventing responding to inappropriate stimuli.}},

However, the precise function of the NAc itself in drug self-administration has been difficult to establish. Here we show a neural double-dissociation of the behavioral processes that underlie cocaine self-administration in rats. Whereas selective excitotoxic lesions of the NAc core had only a minor effect on the acquisition of responding for cocaine under a standard schedule of continuous reinforcement, these lesions profoundly impaired the acquisition of drug-seeking behavior that was maintained by drug-associated conditioned reinforcers and assessed using a second-order schedule of cocaine reinforcement. In contrast, selective excitotoxic lesions of the NAc shell did not impair drug self-administration or the acquisition of cocaine-seeking, but they did attenuate the psychostimulant effects of cocaine. These results further our understanding of how the NAc controls drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior.}},

	abstract = {{As animals learn novel behavioural responses, performance is maintained by two dissociable influences. Initial responding is goal-directed and under voluntary control, but overtraining of the same response routine leads to behavioural autonomy and the development of habits that are no longer voluntary or goal-directed. Rats normally show goal-directed performance after limited training, indexed by sensitivity to changes in the value of reward, but this sensitivity to goal value is lost with extended training. Rats with selective lesions of the prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex showed no sensitivity to goal value after either limited or extended training, whereas rats with lesions of the infralimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex showed the opposite pattern of deficit, a marked sensitivity to goal value after both limited and extended training. This double-dissociation suggests that the prelimbic region is responsible for voluntary response performance and the infralimbic cortex mediates the incremental ability of extended training to override this goal-directed behaviour.}},

	abstract = {Many recent data implicate D1-like receptors in
                  dopamine (DA)-mediated reward-related learning
                  suggesting that DA may produce learning by
                  activating adenylyl cyclase and the cyclic adenosine
                  monophosphate (cAMP) pathway. To evaluate this
                  hypothesis we manipulated cAMP-dependent protein
                  kinase (PKA) in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in
                  DA-dependent learning paradigms. Thus, bilateral
                  intra-NAcc injections of amphetamine (amphet)
                  produced place conditioning and co-injection of the
                  PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMPS with amphet blocked this
                  effect in spite of actually increasing the locomotor
                  stimulant effects of amphet. Injection of the same
                  doses of Rp-cAMPS alone produced no significant
                  effects. Intra-NAcc injections of the PKA activator
                  Sp-cAMPS also impaired amphet-produced place
                  conditioning. In another study, bilateral intra-NAcc
                  injections of amphet over three days led to
                  conditioned activity on a drug free test day and
                  co-injection of Rp-cAMPS with amphet blocked the
                  effect at doses that did not reduce amphet's
                  locomotor stimulant effect. Additionally, Rp-cAMPS
                  injected with amphet into the NAcc impaired the
                  enhancement of responding for conditioned reward but
                  not the stimulant effect. In a final study,
                  preliminary results suggest that Rp-cAMPS in the
                  frontal cortex may impair working memory required
                  for a spatial win-shift task in the radial
                  maze. These results support the hypothesis that
                  activation of the cAMP pathway by DA acting at
                  D1-like receptors leads to learning. (Funded by

                  to monitor dopamine (DA) transmission in nucleus
                  accumbens (NAcc) of rats lever-pressing for
                  food. Under standard conditions, animals responded
                  on a fixed ratio (FR) 1 schedule for 0.2 ml of milk
                  delivered over 30 sec; milk delivery was paired with
                  a 30 sec cue light. Consumption of the initial few
                  milk rewards of the session caused DA signal
                  increases. These initial signal increases were
                  typical of the first and at times the second test
                  days. On subsequent days, however, the most
                  pronounced initial signal increases coincided with
                  presentation of conditioned stimuli that marked the
                  start of the session. Biphasic changes in DA signal
                  that were time-locked to each reinforced lever-press
                  were also observed; responses were preceded by
                  increases and were followed, during milk
                  consumption, by decreases in DA signal. At the end
                  of milk delivery, the signal increased again in
                  apparent anticipation of the next
                  lever-press. Delaying milk delivery caused a
                  corresponding delay in DA signal decreases and the
                  amount of time signals remained depressed was bound
                  by the duration of milk consumption. Greater
                  decreases in DA signal were observed when the rate
                  of milk delivery was doubled or tripled and such
                  increases in reward value were associated with more
                  pronounced signal increases during the period that
                  preceded each lever-press. In contrast, DA signal
                  increases were seen when milk was delivered at half
                  the usual rate or was withheld altogether or when
                  animals were denied access to the lever. Under
                  partial reinforcement conditions, reinforced
                  lever-presses were preceded by more pronounced
                  signal increases and decreases of comparable
                  magnitude accompanied milk consumption. These
                  results suggest that meso-NAcc DA neurons are
                  activated primarily in response to the incentive
                  rather than to the reinforcing properties of
                  rewards. While the present data indicate that food
                  reinforcement can activate the DA projection to
                  NAcc, this effect was found to be transient. One
                  working hypothesis suggested by the present findings
                  is that rewards produce their behavior reinforcing
                  effects as a consequence of suppressing activation
                  of meso-NAcc DA neurons by conditioned
                  incentives. Exactly what mechanism would be
                  responsible for exerting this inhibitory influence
                  is open to speculation. The medial prefrontal cortex
                  (PFC), however, is one possibility made increasingly
                  attractive by evidence that meso-PFC DA neurons act
                  indirectly, via corticofugal inputs to VTA and NAcc,
                  to dampen concurrent increases in NAcc DA
                  transmission. As a first step in exploring this
                  possibility, we investigated how PFC DA levels
                  change in relation to earned food presented under
                  conditions identical to those tested in NAcc DA. In
                  comparison to NAcc, we observed minor DA signal
                  fluctuations in PFC when animals consumed the
                  standard reward on a continuous reinforcement
                  schedule; there was no evidence of
                  experience-dependent changes in these
                  fluctuations. Under delayed reinforcement
                  conditions, lever-presses were followed by DA signal
                  increases that were time-locked to the delay
                  duration and these were followed by signal decreases
                  when animals eventually received the reward. Such
                  decreases became more pronounced when the standard
                  rate of milk delivery was tripled, but were
                  attenuated when milk delivery was reduced to half
                  the usual rate; withholding earned milk resulted in
                  signal increases. In contrast, DA signal increases
                  were observed during milk consumption when the
                  standard meal duration was unexpectedly shortened to
                  15 sec or lengthened to 60 or 90 sec. Orderly
                  changes in DA signal were also observed under
                  partial reinforcement conditions; unreinforced
                  responses were associated with DA signal decreases
                  whereas transient increases were seen during the 30
                  sec meal that followed reinforced responses. These
                  findings indicate that response-contingent reward
                  presentation elicits synchronous changes in PFC DA
                  transmission. They also suggest that the DA input to
                  PFC is activated primarily when rewards are
                  presented under conditions that deviate from those
                  animals had come to expect, particularly so when the
                  temporal structure of learned associations is
                  altered. Such a conclusion would be congruent with
                  the idea that PFC DA plays a role in cognitive
                  processes responsible for the temporal organization
                  of goal-directed behaviors. Finally, the present
                  findings suggest that some of the reward- and
                  behavior-relevant changes seen in NAcc DA may occur
                  as a result of concurrent fluctuations in PFC DA
                  levels. Supported by the Medical Research Council of

                  behavior, incentive and instrumental learning, and
                  that also plays a role in addictive processes. This
                  paper comprises a review of work from our laboratory
                  that focuses on two main research areas: (i) The
                  role of the nucleus accumbens in food motivation,
                  and (ii) Its putative functions in cellular
                  plasticity underlying appetitive learning. First,
                  work within a number of different behavioral
                  paradigms has shown that accumbens neurochemical
                  systems play specific and dissociable roles in
                  different aspects of food seeking and food intake,
                  and part of this function depends on integration
                  with the lateral hypothalamus and amygdala. We
                  propose that the nucleus accumbens integrates
                  information related to cognitive, sensory, and
                  emotional processing with hypothalamic mechanisms
                  mediating energy balance. This system as a whole
                  enables complex hierarchical control of adaptive
                  ingestive behavior. Regarding the second research
                  area, our studies examining acquisition of
                  lever-pressing for food in rats have shown that
                  activation of glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)
                  receptors, within broadly distributed but
                  interconnected regions (nucleus accumbens core,

                  and central amygdala), is critical for such learning
                  to occur. This receptor stimulation triggers
                  intracellular cascades that involve protein
                  phosphorylation and new protein synthesis. It is
                  hypothesized that activity in this distributed
                  network (including D1 receptor activity) computes
                  coincident events and thus enhances the probability
                  that temporally related actions and events
                  (e.g. lever pressing and delivery of reward) become
                  associated. Such basic mechanisms of plasticity
                  within this reinforcement learning network also
                  appear to be profoundly affected in addiction.}},

                  rewards, such as feeding, drinking, sex, exploration
                  and appetitive learning. We have investigated the
                  functional role of neurotransmitter and
                  intracellular transduction mechanisms in behaviors
                  subserved by the core and shell subsystems within
                  the accumbens. Local infusion of the selective NMDA
                  antagonist AP-5 into the accumbens core, but not the
                  shell, completely blocked acquisition of a bar-press
                  response for food in hungry rats. This effect was
                  apparent only when infused during the early stages
                  of learning. We have also recently shown that
                  infusion of certain protein kinase inhibitors into
                  the core also impairs learning in the same
                  paradigm. These results suggest that
                  plasticity-related mechanisms within the accumbens
                  core, involving glutamate-linked intracellular
                  second messengers, are important for
                  response-reinforcement learning. In contrast to the
                  core, which primarily connects to somatic motor
                  output systems, the shell is more intimately linked
                  to viscero-endocrine effector systems. We have shown
                  that both AMPA and GABA receptors within the medial
                  shell (but not the core) are critically involved in
                  controlling the brain's feeding pathways, via
                  activation of the lateral hypothalamus (LH). This
                  effect is blocked by local inhibition of the LH in
                  double-cannulae experiments, and also strongly and
                  selectively activates Fos expression in the
                  LH. These results provide a newly emerging picture
                  of the differentiated functions of this forebrain
                  region, and suggest an integrated role in the

                  in the caudal versus rostral part of the nucleus

                  CCKergic innervation from dopaminergic neurons of
                  the mesencephalic ventral tegmental area, whereas
                  the CCKergic input to the rostral accumbens would
                  originate in non-dopaminergic neurons from
                  extra-mesencephalic areas of the brain. In the
                  present study, this issue was addressed using
                  retrograde tracing techniques in conjunction with
                  immunocytochemistry. Retrograde tracers were
                  injected in the three compartments of the accumbens
                  (i.e., rostral pole, core and septal shell). In
                  summary, our results demonstrate that 1) the main
                  CCKergic input of the accumbens originates in the
                  ventral mesencephalon; 2) the rostral pole is
                  equally innervated by CCK neurons projecting from
                  both substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral
                  tegmental area; 3) the primary source of CCK
                  innervation of the accumbal core is the substantia
                  nigra pars compacta; and 4) whereas the CCKergic
                  input to the septal shell originates primarily in
                  the ventral tegmental area. Additionally, our
                  results also showed that most of the CCKergic
                  neurons projecting to any of the accumbal
                  compartments also produce dopamine. These data
                  constitute the first neuroanatomical evidence for

	abstract = {It has been suggested that accumbens dopamine (DA)
                  is involved in the process of enabling organisms to
                  expend energy in various situations, including
                  foraging, maze running, and lever pressing. Although
                  accumbens DA depletions impair stimulant
                  self-administration, the effects of these depletions
                  on various food-reinforced operant schedules are
                  highly variable. Accumbens DA depletions have little
                  or no effect on total response output in rats
                  responding on the simplest schedule of food
                  reinforcement, i.e., the fixed ratio 1. In addition,
                  it has been shown clearly that the effects of
                  accumbens DA depletions do not resemble the effects
                  of extinction or pre-feeding to reduce food
                  motivation. Over the last several years, our
                  laboratory has investigated the effects of accumbens
                  DA depletions on several schedules, including fixed
                  ratio 1, variable interval 30 sec, fixed interval 30
                  sec, progressive ratio, and fixed ratio 4, 5, 16 and
                  64. These schedules generate very different rates of
                  responding, ranging from 300-3000 responses per 30
                  min. Regression analyses of all these studies
                  indicates a significant linear relation between
                  control rates of responding and the degree of
                  suppression of responding produced by accumbens DA
                  depletions. Schedules that generate relatively low
                  response rates, such as fixed ratio 1 or variable
                  interval 30 sec, are little affected by accumbens DA
                  depletions, yet schedules that generate high
                  response rates (e.g., fixed ratio 64) are severely
                  disrupted. Pre-feeding shows different patterns of
                  suppression as a function of response
                  rate. Microanalysis of the temporal characteristics
                  of lever pressing has shown that accumbens DA
                  depletions produce a response slowing, as measured
                  by the interresponse time; extinction and
                  pre-feeding produce a different pattern of
                  effects. These results indicate that accumbens DA
                  depletions do not blunt the reinforcing effects of
                  food, but do suppress responding in a manner
                  directly related to the baseline rate. Accumbens DA
                  appears to be involved in energy expenditure,
                  behavioral activation, or maintenance of high local
                  rates of responding, which are functions that
                  represent an area of overlap between motor and

                  for some time to contribute importantly to the
                  generation of motor behaviors. Results are presented
                  that support an important role for interactions
                  between nucleus accumbens (NAcc) DA and metabotropic
                  glutamate receptors (mGluR) in the generation of
                  locomotion. Bilateral infusions into the rat NAcc of
                  the mGluR agonist (1S,3R)-ACPD (0.005-2.5
                  nmole/side) dose-dependently increased
                  locomotion. This increase was blocked by 6-OHDA
                  lesions of DA terminals in the NAcc or by
                  co-injections of the mGluR antagonist (RS)-MCPG or
                  the DA receptor antagonist
                  fluphenazine. Co-injection of a dose of (RS)-MCPG
                  that was without locomotor effects of its own
                  completely blocked the increased locomotion produced
                  by either NAcc amphetamine or apomorphine. This
                  latter effect of (RS)-MCPG on NAcc
                  amphetamine-induced locomotion appeared to be due to
                  group II, but not group I, mGluRs since it was
                  mimicked by the group II mGluR antagonist EGLU but
                  not by equimolar doses of the group I mGluR
                  antagonist AIDA. Finally, NAcc (RS)-MCPG, which had
                  no effect on locomotion when given to saline
                  pre-exposed rats, produced significant increases in
                  locomotion when administered to amphetamine
                  pre-exposed rats, suggesting that glutamatergic
                  neurotransmission mediated by NAcc mGluRs is altered
                  by repeated systemic injections of
                  amphetamine. Together, these results support a role
                  for NAcc DA and mGluR interactions in the generation
                  of locomotion and at least one form of plasticity:
                  the sensitization of locomotor activity by
                  psychomotor stimulant drugs.},

                  the firing rate and release of dopamine in the VTA,
                  and this control appears to possess a tonic nature
                  because the corresponding antagonists enhance the
                  somatodendritic release of the transmitter. In
                  addition, the release of dopamine in the VTA is

                  patterns (eating, drinking, copulating, etc.)
                  finalized to the utilization of the biological
                  resources of the reward (caloric, metabolic,
                  genetic, etc.). While some studies reported a
                  stimulation of dopamine transmission in the nucleus
                  accumbens in relation to appetitive as well as
                  consummatory behaviour, other studies reported a
                  relationship exclusively with consummatory
                  behaviour. Therefore, the precise relationship
                  between dopamine transmission in the nucleus
                  accumbens and specific phases of motivated behaviour
                  is debated. On the basis of topographical,
                  histochemical and connectional evidence, the nucleus
                  accumbens has been subdivided into two compartments,
                  a medioventral ''shell'' and a
                  laterodorsal''core''. This heterogeneity may be
                  relevant to the current debate over the role of
                  nucleus accumbens dopamine in behaviour. Thus, one
                  might hypothesize that, depending on the specific
                  compartment of the nucleus accumbens where dopamine
                  transmission is monitored, a different relationship
                  with specific stimuli which motivate behaviour is
                  obtained. In order to verify this possibility we
                  monitored by microdialysis the changes in dopamine
                  transmission in the nucleus accumbens shell and core
                  during appetitive and consummatory phases of
                  behaviour motivated by food. As food we utilized a
                  palatable snack food (Fonzies) whose consumption has
                  been shown in previous studies from our laboratory
                  to release dopamine in the nucleus accumbens shell
                  and in the medial prefrontal cortex. Unpredicted
                  consumption of Fonzies preferentially stimulated
                  dopamine transmission in the shell as compared to
                  the core. Appetitive food stimuli (perforated
                  Fonzies-filled boxes) phasically stimulated dopamine
                  transmission in the core but not in the shell and
                  sensitized the dopamine response to feeding in the
                  core but inhibited that in the shell. These
                  clear-cut differences between nucleus accumbens
                  shell and core suggest that phasic dopamine
                  transmission in each compartment of the nucleus
                  accumbens subserves different roles in motivated
                  behaviour.}},

                  dopamine (DA) activity and/or blockade of NMDA
                  function in nucleus accumbens (NAC), underlie the

                  regimen, and whether core or shell subregions of
                  nucleus accumbens would be more important to such

                  changes in normal (control) rats should reproduce
                  these Pb-induced learning impairments. For this
                  purpose, the effects of DA (20-80 microg), the
                  non-competitive NMDA antagonist MK-801 (1.0-2.5
                  microg) or DA+MK-801 (40+1.0, 80+2.5 microg) were
                  infused in core or shell of nucleus accumbens in
                  normal rats and effects on a multiple schedule of
                  repeated learning (RL) and performance (P)
                  evaluated. In core, MK-801 mimicked the effects of
                  Pb exposure, selectively reducing RL accuracy with
                  no corresponding changes in P accuracy, an effect
                  derived from an increased frequency of perseverative
                  errors. DA produced non-specific changes, reducing
                  accuracy levels in RL and P components. Accuracy and
                  rate effects of DA could be reversed by concurrent
                  administration of the higher MK-801 dose. In shell,
                  MK-801, primarily the lower dose, reduced accuracy
                  in both the RL and P components, while DA did not
                  produce any systematic effects. Collectively, these
                  results point to a greater importance of core as
                  compared to shell in the mediation of learning of
                  spatial sequences, and suggest that inhibition of
                  glutamatergic NMDA function may play a critical role
                  in the selective learning impairments associated

                  to a significantly greater degree in the nucleus

                  disturbance of behavior motivated by
                  drug-conditioned incentives. This abnormality has
                  been explained by Incentive-Sensitization and
                  Allostatic-Counteradaptive theories as the result of
                  non-associative mechanisms acting at the stage of
                  the expression of incentive motivation and
                  responding for drug reinforcement. Each one of these
                  theories, however, does not account per se for two
                  basic properties of the motivational disturbance of
                  drug addiction: (1). focussing on drug- at the
                  expenses of non-drug-incentives; (2). virtual
                  irreversibility. To account for the above aspects we
                  have proposed an associative learning
                  hypothesis. According to this hypothesis the basic
                  disturbance of drug addiction takes place at the
                  stage of acquisition of motivation and in particular
                  of Pavlovian incentive learning. Drugs share with
                  non-drug rewards the property of stimulating
                  dopamine (DA) transmission in the nucleus accumbens
                  shell but this effect does not undergo habituation
                  upon repeated drug exposure, as instead is the case
                  of non-drug rewards. Repetitive, non-decremental
                  stimulation of DA transmission by drugs in the
                  nucleus accumbens septi (NAc) shell abnormally
                  strengthens stimulus-drug associations. Thus,
                  stimuli contingent upon drug reward acquire powerful
                  incentive properties after a relatively limited
                  number of predictive associations with the drug and
                  become particularly resistant to
                  extinction. Non-contingent occurrence of
                  drug-conditioned incentive cues or contexts strongly
                  facilitates and eventually reinstates drug
                  self-administration. Repeated drug exposure also
                  induces a process of sensitization of drug-induced
                  stimulation of DA transmission in the NAc core. The
                  precise significance of this adaptive change for the
                  mechanism of drug addiction is unclear given the
                  complexity and uncertainties surrounding the role of
                  NAc core DA in responding but might be more directly
                  related to instrumental performance.}},

                  changes in postsynaptic responsiveness or
                  excitability. Three lines of evidence suggest that
                  this effect is accounted for by a modification of
                  synaptic effectiveness rather than damage to or
                  fatigue of the stimulated inputs. First, the effect
                  was dependent on the stimulation frequency; 900
                  pulses at 10 Hz caused no lasting change, and at 50
                  Hz a synaptic potentiation was usually
                  observed. Second, the depressed synapses continued
                  to support long-term potentiation in response to a
                  high-frequency tetanus. Third, the effects of
                  conditioning stimulation could be prevented by
                  application of NMDA receptor antagonists. Thus, our
                  data suggest that synaptic depression can be
                  triggered by prolonged NMDA receptor activation that
                  is below the threshold for inducing synaptic
                  potentiation. We propose that this mechanism is
                  important for the modifications of hippocampal
                  response properties that underlie some forms of
                  learning and memory.}},

                  significance of DA in the ventral pallidum. These
                  studies examined the effects of D-amphetamine
                  injected into the nucleus accumbens or ventral
                  pallidum on locomotor activity and responding for a
                  conditioned reward (CR). In the nucleus accumbens
                  D-amphetamine dose dependently (1, 3 and 10 microg)
                  increased locomotion within 5-10 min of
                  injection. Intra-ventral pallidum microinjections of
                  D-amphetamine also increased activity in this dose
                  range, but the effect occurred with a longer latency
                  (5-20 min). The magnitude of the response evoked by
                  ventral pallidum injections was lower than that
                  evoked by nucleus accumbens injections. The GABAA
                  antagonist picrotoxin (0.1 microg) stimulated
                  activity when injected into the ventral pallidum but
                  not the nucleus accumbens, providing a
                  pharmacological dissociation between the two
                  injection sites. In the CR studies, D-amphetamine
                  injected into both sites potentiated responding for
                  a CR previously paired with food delivery, without
                  altering responding on an inactive lever. Picrotoxin
                  injected into the ventral pallidum reduced
                  responding and abolished the selectivity of
                  responding for CR. The results show that DA release
                  in the ventral pallidum enhances locomotion and
                  responding for a CR, providing evidence that DA in
                  the ventral pallidum plays a significant role in the
                  mediation of the effects of D-amphetamine. The
                  failure of picrotoxin to elevate responding for CR
                  despite increasing locomotor activity indicates that
                  pharmacologically-induced blockade of GABAA

                  neurons in combination with chronoamperometric
                  sampling of mesoaccumbens DA efflux to assess the
                  importance of DA in the integration of different
                  limbic inputs to the NAc. Tetanic stimulation of the
                  fimbria potentiated hippocampal-evoked firing
                  activity of NAc neurons and increased DA
                  extracellular levels. Systemic administration of the
                  D(1) receptor antagonist SCH23390 or the NMDA
                  receptor antagonist CPP abolished the potentiation
                  of hippocampal-evoked activity and produced a D(2)
                  receptor-mediated suppression of evoked firing. In
                  neurons that received converging input from the
                  hippocampus and BLA, fimbria tetanus potentiated
                  hippocampal-evoked firing activity and suppressed
                  BLA-evoked activity in the same neurons. Both D(1)
                  and NMDA receptors participated in the potentiation
                  of fimbria-evoked activity, whereas the suppression
                  of BLA-evoked activity was blocked by either D(1)
                  receptor antagonism with SCH23390 or the adenosine
                  A(1) antagonist
                  8-cyclopentyl-1,2-dimethylxanthine. Coincidental
                  tetanus of both the fimbria and BLA resulted in
                  potentiation of both inputs, indicating that DA and
                  adenosine-mediated suppression of BLA-evoked firing
                  was activity-dependent. These data suggest that

                  motivational, and sensory information, the new
                  findings also shed light on fast DA
                  neurotransmission in a behavioral context. This

                  electrophysiological and real-time voltammetric
                  approaches and (2). describes a general model of

                  that the behaviorally evoked DA transients are
                  governed by similar mechanisms as those produced by
                  short trains of electrical stimulation. Thus, action
                  potential-dependent release and presynaptic uptake
                  are primary determinants of functional DA levels in

                  different DA dynamics in forebrain projection
                  fields. The distinct changes result from
                  heterogeneous release and uptake rates and may
                  underlie region-specific effects of DA. Auto- and
                  heteroreceptors, as well as other sites of

                  nor a functional unit.'' This novel concept is
                  derived from the fact that the amygdala is a
                  structure whose anatomical connections and
                  neurochemical features are more strongly
                  interrelated to adjacent parts of the temporal lobe
                  and basal forebrain than to unique characteristics

                  many parts of this volume and merits further
                  examination in the future. The basal forebrain and
                  cortical circuitry described here seem to be
                  critical for a set of behaviors/processes that could
                  be collectively described as cognitive-emotive. For

                  associative learning, decision making, and

                  emotional, motivational, and cognitive state of an
                  organism. More and more studies are demonstrating
                  that small and localized manipulations of the brain

                  investigations of Lennart Heimer and his

                  hippocampal slices that aspartate is co-localized
                  and co-exocytosed with GABA from synaptic vesicles
                  in nerve endings assumed to be inhibitory on dentate

                  idiopathic Parkinson' disease. It has been proposed
                  that parkinsonian tremor results from the activity
                  of the central oscillators. One of the hypotheses,
                  which have been proposed about the possible
                  principles underlying such central oscillations, is
                  the subthalamic nucleus (STN)-external globus
                  pallidus (GPe)-pacemaker hypothesis. Activity from
                  the central oscillator is proposed to be transmitted
                  via trans-cortical pathways to the periphery. A
                  computational model of the basal ganglia (BG) is
                  proposed for simulating the effects of the internal
                  globus pallidus (GPi)-pedunculopontine (PPN) loop
                  activity on the transmission of the

                  cortex, based on known anatomy and physiology of the
                  BG. According to the result of the simulation, the
                  GPi-PPN loop activity can suppress the transmission
                  of the STN-GPe-pacemaker oscillatory activities to
                  the cortex. This suppressive effect is controlled by
                  various factors such as the strength of the synaptic

                  for the core projection to innervate the substantia
                  nigra-lateral mesencephalic tegmentum, and for the

                  pronounced differences between core and shell
                  projections exist in regard to the hypothalamus and

                  as well as to the extended amygdala, especially its
                  sublenticular part. Both the core and shell of the
                  accumbens have unmistakable striatal characteristics
                  both histologically and in their connectional
                  patterns. The shell, however, has additional

                  represents a transitional zone that seems to
                  characterize most of the fringes of the striatal
                  complex, where it adjoins the extended amygdala.}},

                  movements (saccades) by means of their connection to
                  the superior colliculus (SC). The SC receives
                  convergent inputs from cerebral cortical areas and
                  the basal ganglia. To make a saccade to an object
                  purposefully, appropriate signals must be selected
                  out of the cortical inputs, in which the basal
                  ganglia play a crucial role. This is done by the
                  sustained inhibitory input from the substantia nigra
                  pars reticulata (SNr) to the SC. This inhibition can
                  be removed by another inhibition from the caudate
                  nucleus (CD) to the SNr, which results in a
                  disinhibition of the SC. The basal ganglia have

                  working memory, expectation, and
                  attention. Expectation of reward is a critical
                  determinant in that the saccade that has been
                  rewarded is facilitated subsequently. The
                  interaction between cortical and dopaminergic inputs

                  rats express greater behavioral activation than rats
                  which were previously habituated to that
                  environment. The circuit containing the ventral
                  tegmental area, nucleus accumbens and ventral
                  pallidum is required for the expression of locomotor
                  activity elicited by amphetamine-like
                  psychostimulants. It was hypothesized that this
                  circuit is necessary for the expression of
                  novelty-induced motor activity. Dopamine is a
                  neurotransmitter in the projection from the ventral
                  tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens, while GABA
                  is contained in the projections from the nucleus
                  accumbens to the ventral pallidum and from the
                  ventral pallidum back to the ventral tegmental
                  area. Prior to exposing rats to a novel or
                  habituated environment, they received a
                  microinjection of either saline vehicle or one of
                  the following drugs: fluphenazine (dopamine
                  antagonist) into the nucleus accumbens, muscimol
                  (GABAA agonist) into the ventral pallidum, or
                  baclofen GABAB agonist) into the ventral tegmental
                  area. Each of these pretreatments prevented
                  novelty-induced motor activation without suppressing
                  the activity of habituated animals. In contrast,
                  when these microinjections were made into adjacent
                  motor nuclei of the basal ganglia, including
                  fluphenazine into the striatum, muscimol into the
                  globus pallidus and baclofen into the substantia
                  nigra, they were ineffective in blocking
                  novelty-induced motor activity. These data indicate
                  that the integrity of the circuit that contains the
                  ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens and

                  and ventral tegmental area (VTA) respond to a wide
                  category of salient stimuli. Activation of SN and
                  VTA DA neurons, and consequent release of
                  nigrostriatal and mesolimbic DA, modulates the
                  processing of concurrent glutamate inputs to dorsal
                  and ventral striatal target regions. According to
                  the view described here, this occurs under
                  conditions of unexpected environmental change
                  regardless of whether that change is rewarding or
                  aversive. Nigrostriatal and mesolimbic DA activity
                  gates the input of sensory, motor, and incentive
                  motivational (e.g. reward) signals to the
                  striatum. In light of recent single-unit and brain
                  imaging data, it is suggested that the striatal
                  reward signals originate in the orbitofrontal cortex
                  and basolateral amygdala (BLA), regions that project
                  strongly to the striatum. A DA signal of salient
                  unexpected event occurrence, from this framework,
                  gates the throughput of the orbitofrontal glutamate
                  reward input to the striatum just as it gates the
                  throughput of corticostriatal sensory and motor
                  signals needed for normal response
                  execution. Processing of these incoming signals is
                  enhanced when synaptic DA levels are high, because
                  DA enhances the synaptic efficacy of strong
                  concurrent glutamate inputs while reducing the
                  efficacy of weak glutamate inputs. The impairments
                  in motor performance and incentive motivational
                  processes that follow from nigrostriatal and
                  mesolimbic DA loss can be understood in terms of a
                  single mechanism: abnormal processing of
                  sensorimotor and incentive motivation-related
                  glutamate input signals to the striatum.}},

                  a mixture of dopamine D(1) (SKF 38393, 5 microg) and
                  D(2) (quinpirole, 10 microg) receptor agonists into
                  the shell has been found to elicit contraversive
                  pivoting. The dopamine D(1)/D(2) receptor
                  antagonist, cis-(Z)-flupentixol (1 and 10 microg),
                  injected into the shell, in doses known to block
                  dopamine D(1)/D(2) receptor-mediated pivoting, also
                  significantly inhibited AMPA (0.5 microg)-induced
                  pivoting. Moreover, both NBQX (1 and 10 ng) and
                  MK-801 (0.1 and 0.5 microg), injected into the
                  shell, significantly inhibited dopamine D(1)/D(2)
                  receptor-mediated pivoting. It is therefore
                  concluded that unilateral stimulation of AMPA
                  receptors in the shell of the nucleus accumbens can
                  elicit contraversive pivoting, and that both AMPA
                  and dopamine D(1)/D(2) receptors play a critical
                  role in shell-specific pivoting in contrast to NMDA
                  receptors that at best play only a modulatory

                  of the GABA(A) receptor agonist, muscimol (25-100

The pivoting induced by a mixture of SKF 38393 (5 microg) and quinpirole (10 microg) injected into the nucleus accumbens shell was significantly inhibited by bicuculline (50 ng) injected into the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, whereas muscimol (25 ng) had no effect. Neither muscimol (25 ng) nor bicuculline (50 ng) modulated the contraversive circling induced by carbachol (5 microg) injected into the nucleus accumbens shell. It is therefore concluded that unilateral stimulation of GABA(A) receptors in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus can elicit contraversive pivoting and that the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus is one of the output stations of the accumbens region that mediates shell-specific, dopaminergic pivoting, but not of the accumbens region that mediates shell-specific, cholinergic circling.}},

                  was manipulated within a single behavioral
                  session. Rats were well-trained on a continuous
                  reinforcement instrumental task reinforced by 0.1 ml
                  drops of 5\% sucrose. Extracellular single-unit
                  neural activity was recorded from electrode arrays
                  implanted into the NAC when instrumental behavior
                  was and then was not reinforced with sucrose
                  (within-session extinction). A variable delay
                  between the instrumental response and the sucrose
                  delivery allowed for separation of neural activity
                  related to these task events. A spike activity
                  increase around the time of the instrumental
                  response was the most common behavioral correlate,
                  while a decrease in spike activity upon sucrose
                  delivery was the second most common behavioral
                  correlate. Following removal of the reinforcer,
                  subjects continued to perform the instrumental
                  response, allowing for the examination of
                  response-related spike activity under extinction
                  conditions in which the response was no longer
                  reinforced by sucrose. A majority of the
                  response-related neural activity patterns were lost
                  when sucrose was no longer available. New neural
                  responses also were detected during this period. For
                  some subjects, the reinforcer was again made
                  available during the same session. Encoding of the
                  primary behavioral events during this period of
                  reinstated reinforcer was similar, but not
                  identical, to that observed during the first period
                  of reinforced responding. These findings reveal that
                  instrumental task-associated spike activity within
                  the NAC is partially dependent upon the presence of
                  the reinforcer, and that encoding across the

                  information processing in the basal ganglia have
                  been developed in recent years. Prominent in these
                  are actor-critic models of basal ganglia
                  functioning, which build on the strong resemblance
                  between dopamine neuron activity and the temporal
                  difference prediction error signal in the critic,
                  and between dopamine-dependent long-term synaptic
                  plasticity in the striatum and learning guided by a
                  prediction error signal in the actor. We selectively
                  review several actor-critic models of the basal
                  ganglia with an emphasis on two important aspects:
                  the way in which models of the critic reproduce the
                  temporal dynamics of dopamine firing, and the extent
                  to which models of the actor take into account known
                  basal ganglia anatomy and physiology. To complement
                  the efforts to relate basal ganglia mechanisms to
                  reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce an
                  alternative approach to modeling a critic network,
                  which uses Evolutionary Computation techniques to
                  'evolve' an optimal RL mechanism, and relate the
                  evolved mechanism to the basic model of the
                  critic. We conclude our discussion of models of the
                  critic by a critical discussion of the anatomical
                  plausibility of implementations of a critic in basal
                  ganglia circuitry, and conclude that such
                  implementations build on assumptions that are
                  inconsistent with the known anatomy of the basal
                  ganglia. We return to the actor component of the
                  actor-critic model, which is usually modeled at the
                  striatal level with very little detail. We describe
                  an alternative model of the basal ganglia which
                  takes into account several important, and previously
                  neglected, anatomical and physiological
                  characteristics of basal ganglia-thalamocortical
                  connectivity and suggests that the basal ganglia
                  performs reinforcement-biased dimensionality
                  reduction of cortical inputs. We further suggest
                  that since such selective encoding may bias the
                  representation at the level of the frontal cortex
                  towards the selection of rewarded plans and actions,
                  the reinforcement-driven dimensionality reduction
                  framework may serve as a basis for basal ganglia
                  actor models. We conclude with a short discussion of
                  the dual role of the dopamine signal in RL and in
                  behavioral switching.}},

                  organization: a tripartite functional (motor,
                  associative and limbic) subdivision and a
                  compartmental (patch/striosome-matrix)
                  subdivision. The topography of other basal ganglia
                  projections to the dopaminergic system with respect
                  to their tripartite functional subdivision is also
                  reviewed. This examination indicates that, in rats
                  and primates, the following observations can be
                  made. (1) The limbic striatum reciprocates its
                  dopaminergic input and in addition innervates most
                  of the dopaminergic neurons projecting to the
                  associative and motor striatum, whereas the motor
                  and associative striatum reciprocate only part of
                  their dopaminergic input. Therefore, the connections
                  of the three striatal subregions with the
                  dopaminergic system are asymmetrical, but the
                  direction of asymmetry differs between the limbic
                  versus the motor and associative striatum. (2) The
                  limbic striatum provides the main striatal input to
                  dopamine cell bodies and proximal dendrites, with
                  some contribution from a subset of neurons in the
                  associative and motor striatum (patch neurons in
                  rats; an unspecified group of neurons in primates),
                  while striatal input to the ventrally extending
                  dopamine dendrites arises mainly from a subset of
                  neurons in the associative and motor striatum
                  (matrix neurons in rats; an unspecified group of
                  neurons in primates). (3) Projections from
                  functionally corresponding subdivisions of the
                  striatum, pallidum and subthalamic nucleus to the
                  dopaminergic system overlap, but the specific
                  targets (dopamine cells, dopamine dendrites, GABA
                  cells) of these projections differ. Major
                  differences include the following. (1) In rats,
                  neurons projecting to the motor and associative
                  striatum reside in distinct regions, while in
                  primates they are arranged in interdigitating
                  clusters. (2) In rats, the terminal fields of
                  projections arising from the motor and associative
                  striatum are largely segregated, while in primates
                  they are not. (3) In rats, patch- and
                  matrix-projecting dopamine cells are organized in
                  spatially, morphologically, histochemically and
                  hodologically distinct ventral and dorsal tiers,
                  while in primates there is no (bi)division of the
                  dopaminergic system that results in two areas which
                  have all the characteristics of the two tiers in
                  rats.Based on the anatomical data and known dopamine
                  cell physiology, we forward an hypothesis regarding
                  the influence of the basal ganglia on dopamine cell
                  activity which captures at least part of the complex
                  interplay taking place within the substantia nigra
                  between projections arising from the different basal
                  ganglia nuclei. Finally, we incorporate the striatal
                  connections with the dopaminergic system into an
                  open-interconnected scheme of basal
                  ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry.}},

                  behaviors subserved by the core and shell subsystems
                  within the accumbens. Local infusion of the
                  selective NMDA antagonist, AP-5, into the accumbens
                  core, but not the shell, completely blocked
                  acquisition of a bar-press response for food in
                  hungry rats. This effect was apparent only when
                  infused during the early stages of learning. We have
                  also recently shown that infusion of certain protein
                  kinase inhibitors into the core also impairs

                  intracellular second messengers, are important for
                  response-reinforcement learning. In contrast to the
                  core, which primarily connects to somatic motor
                  output systems, the shell is more intimately linked
                  to viscero-endocrine effector systems. We have shown
                  that both AMPA and GABA receptors within the medial
                  shell (but not the core) are critically involved in

                  perform self-stimulation resulted in an increase in

                  important neural interface between corticolimbic and

                  shown that the NAC is not only involved in
                  motivation and reward-related processes but also in
                  spatial behavior. We here investigated the
                  involvement of different glutamate receptor
                  subclasses within NAC core and shell subregions on
                  behavior in a radial-maze. Rats were first trained

                  baseline performance. Thereafter, the effects of

                  duration of arm-entries were
                  evaluated. Microinjection of all drugs increased
                  RME. Additionally, non-NMDA receptor blockade in NAC
                  shell but not core increased WME. After

                  rats preferentially choose the arms next to the

                  glutamate receptors in both NAC subregions are
                  important for spatial behavior. The deficits seen

                  quinolinic acid and the effects of systemic
                  dizocilpine (0.08 and 0.16 mg/kg) on locomotion and
                  stereotyped sniffing behavior were determined. It
                  was found that systemic and local dizocilpine
                  administration increased dopamine release in the
                  ventral pallidum to a similar extent whereas only
                  systemic treatment was accompanied by locomotor
                  stimulation. Lesion of the ventral pallidum did not
                  affect locomotion and stereotyped sniffing behavior

                  release in the ventral pallidum that is elevated by

                  stimulation would have a role in controlling

The accumbens receives afferent input from corticolimbic and thalamic structures, which is primarily coded by excitatory amino acids (EAAs). The present studies investigated the role of EAA input to the nucleus accumbens in feeding behavior in rats, in two recently characterized subregions of the accumbens, the ''core'' and ''shell''. In the first series of experiments, it was shown that blockade of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate glutamate receptors in the medial part of the accumbens, corresponding to the medial shell subregion, resulted in a pronounced feeding response. Bilateral microinfusion of 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX, 0.25-0.75 micrograms/0.5 microliters), 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline (CNQX, 0.75-1.5 micrograms), and 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo-(F) quinoxaline (NBQX, 0.2-1.0 micrograms) markedly stimulated food intake immediately following infusion, in a dose-dependent manner. Infusion of DNQX into the central accumbens region, corresponding to the core, did not elicit feeding. Infusion of the NMDA antagonists 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5) and MK-801 (dizocilpine maleate) did not elicit feeding in either region. The feeding response to DNQX was blocked by local coinfusion of AMPA. Systemic pretreatment with naltrexone (5 mg/kg) had no effect on the DNQX-feeding response; however, prior systemic administration of both D-1 and D-2 antagonists reduced the response by half, suggesting a modulatory role for dopamine in the response. Moreover, the feeding response was completely inhibited by concurrent infusion of the GABAA agonist muscimol (10, 25 ng) into the lateral hypothalamus, a major projection area of the accumbens shell. These findings demonstrate a selective role for non-NMDA receptors in the nucleus accumbens shell in ingestive behavior, and suggest an important functional link between two major brain regions involved in reward, the nucleus accumbens and lateral hypothalamus.}},

	abstract = {{The ventral pallidum receives major inputs from the
                  nucleus accumbens, a striatal region related to the
                  prefrontal cortex. The ventral pallidum, through its
                  projections to the mediodorsal nucleus of the
                  thalamus, has been considered as the main output
                  structure of the prefrontal-basal ganglia
                  circuits. However, as shown recently, the ventral
                  pallidum also sends efferents to the subthalamic
                  nucleus and the substantia nigra, suggesting that it
                  could participate in intrinsic basal ganglia
                  circuits. The aim of the present investigation was
                  to determine the position of the ventral pallidum in
                  the prefrontal-basal ganglia circuit originating
                  from the prelimbic and medial orbital
                  areas. Following injections of biocytin (an
                  anterograde tracer) into the region of the core of
                  the nucleus accumbens receiving excitatory inputs
                  from the prelimbic and medial orbital areas, axonal
                  terminal fields were observed in a delineated dorsal
                  region of the ventral pallidum. When the biocytin
                  injections were made into this ventral pallidal
                  region, anterogradely labelled fibres were observed
                  in both the dorsomedial substantia nigra pars
                  reticulata and the medial subthalamic nucleus, but
                  not in the mediodorsal nucleus of the
                  thalamus. Confirming these anatomical observations,
                  electrical stimulation of the core of the nucleus
                  accumbens induced an inhibition of the spontaneous
                  activity (D=34.9+/-13.3 ms, L=9.2+/-3.3 ms) in 46.5
                  per cent of the ventral pallidal cells. Among these
                  responding cells, 43 per cent were antidromically
                  driven from the subthalamic nucleus, 30 per cent
                  from the substantia nigra pars reticulata and only 6
                  per cent from the mediodorsal nucleus of the
                  thalamus. These data demonstrate that the region of
                  the ventral pallidum involved in the prefrontal
                  cortex-basal ganglia circuit originating from the
                  prelimbic and medial orbital areas represents
                  essentially a ventral subcommissural extension of
                  the external segment of the globus pallidus since it
                  exhibits similar extrinsic connections and
                  functional characteristics. In conclusion, in this
                  prelimbic and medial orbital channel, the ventral
                  pallidum cannot be considered as a major output
                  structure but is essentially involved in intrinsic
                  basal ganglia circuits.}},

	abstract = {{Intracranial self-administration (ICSA) and
                  intracranial place conditioning (ICPC) methodologies
                  have been mainly used to study drug reward
                  mechanisms, but they have also been applied toward
                  examining brain reward mechanisms. ICSA studies in
                  rodents have established that the ventral tegmental
                  area (VTA) is a site supporting morphine and ethanol
                  reinforcement. ICPC studies confirmed that injection
                  of morphine into the VTA produces conditioned place
                  preference (CPP). Further confirmation that
                  activation of opioid receptors within the VTA is
                  reinforcing comes from the findings that the
                  endogenous opioid peptide met-enkephalin injected
                  into the VTA produces CPP, and that the mu- and
                  delta-opioid agonists, DAMGO and DPDPE, are
                  self-infused into the VTA. Activation of the VTA
                  dopamine (DA) system may produce reinforcing effects
                  in general because (a) neurotensin is
                  self-administered into the VTA, and injection of
                  neurotensin into the VTA produces CPP and enhances
                  DA release in the nucleus accumbens (NAC), and (b)
                  GABA(A) antagonists are self-administered into the
                  anterior VTA and injections of GABA(A) antagonists
                  into the anterior VTA enhance DA release in the
                  NAC. The NAC also appears to have a major role in
                  brain reward mechanisms, whereas most data from ICSA
                  and ICPC studies do not support an involvement of
                  the caudate-putamen in reinforcement
                  processes. Rodents will self-infuse a variety of
                  drugs of abuse (e.g. amphetamine, morphine,
                  phencyclidine and cocaine) into the NAC, and this
                  occurs primarily in the shell region. ICPC studies
                  also indicate that injection of amphetamine into the
                  shell portion of the NAC produces CPP. Activation of
                  the DA system within the shell subregion of the NAC
                  appears to play a key role in brain reward
                  mechanisms. Rats will ICSA the DA uptake blocker,
                  nomifensine, into the NAC shell; co-infusion with a
                  D2 antagonist can block this behavior. In addition,
                  rats will self-administer a mixture of a D1 plus a
                  D2 agonist into the shell, but not the core, region
                  of the NAC. The ICSA of this mixture can be blocked
                  with the co-infusion of either a D1 or a D2
                  antagonist. However, the interactions of other
                  transmitter systems within the NAC may also play key
                  roles because NMDA antagonists and the muscarinic
                  agonist carbachol are self-infused into the NAC. The
                  medial prefrontal (MPF) cortex supports the ICSA of
                  cocaine and phencyclidine. The DA system also seems
                  to play a role in this behavior since cocaine
                  self-infusion into the MPF cortex can be blocked by
                  co-infusing a D2 antagonist, or with 6-OHDA lesions
                  of the MPF cortex. Limited studies have been
                  conducted on other CNS regions to elucidate their
                  role in brain and drug reward mechanisms using ICSA
                  or ICPC procedures. Among these regions, ICPC
                  findings suggest that cocaine and amphetamine are
                  rewarding in the rostral ventral pallidum (VP); ICSA
                  and ICPC studies indicate that morphine is rewarding
                  in the dorsal hippocampus, central gray and lateral
                  hypothalamus. Finally, substance P mediated systems
                  within the caudal VP (nucleus basalis
                  magnocellularis) and serotonin systems of the dorsal
                  and median raphe nuclei may also be important
                  anatomical components involved in brain reward
                  mechanisms. Overall, the ICSA and ICPC studies
                  indicate that there are a number of receptors,
                  neuronal pathways, and discrete CNS sites involved
                  in brain reward mechanisms.}},

	abstract = {{There is extensive evidence that the amygdala is
                  involved in affectively influenced memory. The
                  central hypothesis guiding the research reviewed in
                  this paper is that emotional arousal activates the
                  amygdala and that such activation results in the
                  modulation of memory storage occurring in other
                  brain regions. Several lines of evidence support
                  this view. First, the effects of stress-related
                  hormones (epinephrine and glucocorticoids) are
                  mediated by influences involving the amygdala. In
                  rats, lesions of the amygdala and the stria
                  terminalis block the effects of posttraining
                  administration of epinephrine and glucocorticoids on
                  memory. Furthermore, memory is enhanced by
                  posttraining intraamygdala infusions of drugs that
                  activate beta-adrenergic and glucocorticoid
                  receptors. Additionally, infusion of beta-adrenergic
                  blockers into the amygdala blocks the
                  memory-modulating effects of epinephrine and
                  glucocorticoids, as well as those of drugs affecting
                  opiate and GABAergic systems. Second, an intact
                  amygdala is not required for expression of
                  retention. Inactivation of the amygdala prior to
                  retention testing (by posttraining lesions or drug
                  infusions) does not block retention
                  performance. Third, findings of studies using human
                  subjects are consistent with those of animal
                  experiments. beta-Blockers and amygdala lesions
                  attenuate the effects of emotional arousal on
                  memory. Additionally, 3-week recall of emotional
                  material is highly correlated with positronemission
                  tomography activation (cerebral glucose metabolism)
                  of the right amygdala during encoding. These
                  findings provide strong evidence supporting the
                  hypothesis that the amygdala is involved in
                  modulating long-term memory storage.}},

                  multiple channels of basal ganglia-thalamocortical
                  connections, and the connections of their related
                  nuclei. The prefrontal and motor areas consist of a
                  number of modules, which seem to provide multiple
                  subloops of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical
                  connections in subhuman primates. There may be a
                  great degree of convergence of the limbic,
                  associative and motor loops at the level of the
                  striatum, substantia nigra, pallidum, and the
                  subthalamic nucleus as well as the pedunculopontine
                  nucleus. Nigral dopaminergic neurons receive limbic
                  input directly as well as indirectly through the
                  striosomes in the striatum. Dopamine contributes to
                  behavioral learning by signaling motivation and
                  reinforcement. The pedunculopontine nucleus might be
                  involved in behavioral state control, learning and
                  reinforcement processes, locomotion and autonomic
                  functions. Each subdivision of the motor areas
                  receives a mixed and weighted transthalamic input
                  from both the cerebellum and basal ganglia. In
                  particular, based on the author's data, the hand/arm
                  motor area and adjacent premotor area receive strong
                  superficial basal ganglia-thalamocortical
                  projections as well as the deep
                  cerebello-thalamocortical projections. These areas,
                  have very dense corticocotrical connections with
                  other cortical areas, receive polymodal afferents
                  from the parietal and temporal cortices, and
                  integrated information, via multiple routes, from
                  the prefrontal cortex. The author suggests that the
                  ventrolateral part of the caudal medial pallidal
                  segment (GPi) and the ventromedial part of the GPi
                  are linked directly to these areas by ways of the
                  oral part of ventral lateral nucleus (VLo) and the
                  ventral part of the parvicellular part of ventral
                  anterior nucleus (VApc), respectively. These
                  connections are thought to be involved in the

                  it is not clear whether this effect occurs because
                  of a general disruption of food motivation. One way
                  of assessing this has been a choice procedure in
                  which a rat responds on an fixed ratio 5 (FR5)
                  schedule for preferred Bioserve pellets while a less
                  preferred lab chow is concurrently available in the
                  operant chamber. Untreated rats consume little of
                  the chow, preferring to respond for the Bioserve
                  pellets. Previous studies have shown that depleting
                  DA in the accumbens substantially decreased lever
                  pressing while increasing chow consumption. In the
                  present study, low doses (0.0625-1.0 microg) of the
                  D1 antagonist SCH 23390 or the D2 antagonist
                  raclopride were injected into the either the core or
                  shell subregions of nucleus accumbens, and rats were
                  tested on the concurrent lever pressing/feeding
                  task. Analysis of the dose response curves showed
                  that injections of SCH 23390 into the core were more
                  potent than injections into the shell for
                  suppressing lever pressing (i.e., the ED(50) was
                  lower in the core). Nevertheless, injections of
                  either drug into either site suppressed lever
                  pressing and increased intake of the concurrently
                  available chow. Across both drugs and at both sites,
                  the amount of chow consumed was negatively
                  correlated with the total number of
                  responses. Neither drug significantly increased
                  response duration, suggesting that accumbens DA
                  antagonism did not produce the type of motor
                  impairment that leads to severe alterations in the
                  form of lever pressing. In summary, the blockade of
                  D1 or D2 receptors in nucleus accumbens core or
                  shell decreased lever pressing for food reinforcers,
                  but rats remained directed toward the acquisition
                  and consumption of food. These results indicate that
                  accumbens D1 antagonism does not decrease lever
                  pressing because of a general reduction in food
                  motivation. Nevertheless, interference with
                  accumbens DA does appear to set constraints upon
                  which responses are selected for obtaining food, and
                  may impair the ability of animals to overcome
                  work-related response costs in order to obtain
                  food.}},

                  neurons were studied using in vivo intracellular
                  recording techniques. Neurons recorded in the
                  accumbens displayed one of three activity states:
                  (1) silent, (2) spontaneously firing at low,
                  constant rates, or (3) a bistable membrane
                  potential, characterized by alternating periods of
                  activity and silence occurring in concert with
                  spontaneous transitions between two steady-state
                  membrane potentials (average, -77.3 +/- 7.1 mV base,
                  -63.0 +/- 7.4 mV plateau). These neurons also
                  exhibited a high degree of convergence of responses
                  elicited by stimulation of each of the three
                  excitatory inputs tested. Activation of hippocampal
                  afferents, but not cortical, amygdaloid, or thalamic
                  afferents, induced bistable cells to switch to the
                  depolarized (active) state. In contrast, no bistable
                  cells were encountered in the nucleus accumbens
                  following an acute transection of the
                  fornix. Furthermore, microinjection of lidocaine in
                  the vicinity of the hippocampal afferents at the
                  level of the fornix caused a reversible elimination
                  of the plateau phase in bistable cells. These data
                  suggest that hippocampal input is necessary for
                  accumbens neurons to enter a depolarized, active
                  state. Furthermore, activation of prefrontal
                  cortical inputs fail to evoke spike firing in
                  accumbens neurons unless they are in this active
                  state. Consequently, the hippocampus appears to be
                  capable of gating prefrontal corticoaccumbens

                  nucleus accumbens (NA) are subserved by the activity
                  of ensembles of neurons rather than by an overall
                  neuronal activation. Indeed, the NA is a site of
                  convergence for a large number of inputs from limbic
                  structures that may modulate the flow of prefrontal
                  cortical information and contribute to defining such
                  ensembles, as exemplified in the ability of
                  hippocampal input to gate cortical throughput in the
                  nucleus accumbens. NA neurons exhibit a bistable
                  membrane potential, characterized by a very negative
                  resting membrane potential (down state),
                  periodically interrupted by plateau depolarizations
                  (up state), during which the cells may fire in
                  response to cortical inputs. A dynamic ensemble can
                  be the result of a distributed set of neurons in
                  their up state, determined by the moment-to-moment
                  changes in the spatial distribution of hippocampal
                  inputs responsible for transitions to the up
                  state. Ensembles may change as an adaptation to the
                  contextual information provided by the hippocampal
                  input. Furthermore, for dynamic ensembles to be
                  functionally relevant, the model calls for near
                  synchronous transitions to the up state in a group
                  of neurons. This can be accomplished by the
                  cell-to-cell transfer of information via gap
                  junctions, a mechanism that can allow for a transfer
                  of slow electrical signals, including''up'' events
                  between coupled cells. Furthermore, gap junction
                  permeability is tightly modulated by a number of
                  factors, including levels of dopamine and nitric
                  oxide, and cortical inputs, allowing for fine-tuning
                  of this synchronization of up events. The continuous
                  selection of such dynamic ensembles in the NA may be
                  disputed in schizophrenia, resulting in an
                  inappropriate level of activity of thalamocortical
                  systems.}},

	abstract = {{It has been suggested that the cortico- and
                  limbic-striatal systems are important in various
                  motor functions such as motivated behaviors. In this
                  paper we review our previous studies to investigate
                  neuronal mechanisms of feeding behaviors. We
                  recorded neuronal activity from the amygdala,
                  caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, and substantia
                  nigra during feeding behavior in monkeys, and
                  compared neuronal responses recorded from these
                  brain areas. First, of 710 amygdalar neurons tested,
                  129 (18.2%) responded to single sensory stimulation
                  (48 to vision, 32 to audition, 49 to ingestion), 142
                  (20%) to multimodal stimulation, and 20 to only one
                  item with affective significance. Eight food related
                  amygdalar neurons were tested in reversal by salting
                  food or introducing saline, and all responses were
                  modulated by reversal. These results suggest that
                  the amygdala might be important in ongoing
                  recognition of the affective significance of complex
                  stimuli (food-nonfood discrimination). Second,
                  activity was recorded from 351 neurons in the head
                  of the caudate nucleus of monkeys during an operant
                  feeding task. The 16% of these neurons responded in
                  the discrimination phase. Some of these neurons
                  responded specifically to food. The magnitude of
                  these food-specific neurons depended on the
                  rewarding nature of the food (reward value), and was
                  inversely related to the latency of the onset of bar
                  press. Of the caudate neurons, 10% responded in the
                  bar press phase. Activity of most neurons which
                  responded in the bar press phase was not correlated
                  to individual bar presses. Cooling of the
                  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex abolished sustained
                  responses during bar pressing, but did not abolish
                  the feeding behavior. However, bar press speed
                  tended to be delayed by prefrontal cooling. Third,
                  activity of 358 neurons was recorded from the monkey
                  globus pallidus, and 204 neurons responded during
                  the feeding task. In the globus pallidus, few
                  neurons responded to food in the discrimination
                  phase. On the other hand, activity of most
                  responsive neurons changed during bar press and/or
                  ingestion phases. Activity of about half of these
                  responsive neurons was directly related to specific
                  feeding motor acts such as arm extension, flexion,
                  bar pressing, grasping, chewing, etc. Some of these
                  neurons showed motor-related responses with gradual
                  and preparatory responses. These motor-related
                  neurons were located mainly in the caudodorsal part
                  of the globus pallidus. On the other hand, about one
                  third, especially in the rostroventral part of the
                  globus pallidus, showed dissociating responses in
                  that they responded during bar pressing for food or
                  during ingestion in an operant task, but not during
                  bar pressing for nonfood or during forcible
                  ingestion. The response magnitude of the neurons
                  during arm extension and bar pressing depended on
                  the nature of the food. Fourth, activity of 261
                  neurons was recorded from the substantia nigra pars
                  reticulata. Most of responding neurons (more than
                  two-thirds of the recorded neurons) responded during
                  the bar press and/or ingestion phases. Activity of
                  the one-third of neurons was related to specific
                  motor execution such as arm extension, flexion and
                  bar pressing, but not to motor preparation. These
                  neurons were located mainly in the rostral part of
                  the nucleus. More than one-third of the recorded
                  neurons responded during feeding and/or drinking
                  acts and intra- and perioral sensory stimuli, and
                  were located mainly in the caudomedial part of the
                  nucleus. Based upon these responses and known
                  anatomical evidence, various information including
                  that from the amygdala and prefrontal cortex is
                  integrated in the basal ganglia, and converted to
                  coordinated motivated behaviors such as feeding

                  composed of the striatum, the pallidum, and the

                  the complexities of the organization of the

                  (GPe) are classically viewed as part of the
                  so-called indirect pathway, which acts in concert
                  with the direct pathway. The direct and indirect
                  pathways form the conceptual framework of the
                  anatomical and functional organization of the basal
                  ganglia. A review of recent data regarding the
                  connections of the subthalamic nucleus and the GPe
                  has revealed a lack of firm anatomical support for
                  the existence of the indirect pathway. However,
                  newly recognized projections of the subthalamic
                  nucleus and the GPe place these structures on
                  various novel routes that change the conceptual
                  architecture of the basal ganglia circuitry. These
                  new findings force us to modify our view of the
                  functional identity of the subthalamic nucleus and
                  the GPe. In this new perspective, the GPe stands as
                  an additional integrative station, together with the
                  striatum and the internal pallidum and substantia
                  nigra pars reticulata (GPi/SNr), along the main
                  steam of information processing within the basal
                  ganglia circuitry. Because of its crucial position
                  between the input and output stations of the basal
                  ganglia, the GPe can markedly influence the neuronal
                  computation that occurs at GPi/SNr levels. The
                  subthalamic nucleus can still be regarded as a
                  'control structure' lying alongside the main stream
                  of information processing. However, because of its
                  widespread efferent projections, the subthalamic
                  nucleus exerts its driving effect on most components

                  differentiate the striosome/matrix striatal
                  compartments. Most dorsal tier SNc axons terminate
                  within the matrix of the dorsal striatum, but their
                  patterns of arborization vary markedly; some axons
                  innervate one specific matriceal area, whereas
                  others arborize in multiple discontinuous loci. Some
                  dorsal tier SNc axons also project to both

                  associations to innate rewards or punishments. When
                  a conditioned stimulus (CS) is associated with a
                  reward, it acquires pleasant feelings due to the
                  temporal correlation of the activations representing
                  its sensory features with those representing innate
                  visceral reward acquisition processes. When the CS
                  is associated with the punishment, it acquires
                  unpleasant feelings due to the correlation of its
                  sensory features with the innate visceral inhibition

                  medial prefrontal cortex, and more lateral

                  responses (or attempts to improve the environment)
                  made on the basis of the feelings of such
                  stimuli. Covert memory scans, in which comparisons

                  to the motivations and attention behind the
                  conscious selection of a current response. This
                  model appears to fit together various empirical
                  observations. Its relations to some higher or more

                  cell/myelin stains. The main findings can be
                  summarized as follows: (i) the dorsal striatum of
                  rat and other myomorph rodents reveals a small
                  caudate equivalent homotopic to the caudate nucleus
                  (C) of other mammals, and a large putamen (Pu). (ii)
                  Shell and core can be distinguished also in the
                  'rostral pole' of nucleus accumbens (ACC) with the
                  calretinin/calbindin and neuropeptide Y (NPY)
                  immunostaining. The shell reveals characteristics of
                  a genuine striatal but not of an extended amygdala
                  (EA) subunit. (iii) EA and lateral septum show
                  striking similarities in structure and fiber
                  connections and may therefore represent a separate
                  parastriatal complex. (iv) The meandering dense
                  layer (DL) of olfactory tubercle (OT) forms
                  longitudinal gyrus- and sulcus-like structures
                  converging in its rostral pole. (v) The core regions
                  of the islands of Calleja that border the ventral
                  pallidum (VP) sharing some of its features are
                  invaded by myelinated fibers of the medial forebrain
                  bundle (MFB). The island of Calleja magna is also
                  apposed to an inconspicuous, slender dorsal
                  appendage of VP. (vi) The VP is composed of a large
                  dorsal reticulated part traversed by the myelinated
                  GABAergic parvalbumin-immunoreactive axons of the
                  MFB and a slender ventral non-reticulate part close
                  to the islands of Calleja. (vii) Considering their
                  close association to the limbic system, ventral
                  striatum (VS) and VP may represent the oldest part
                  of basal ganglia, whereas dorsal striatopallidal
                  subunits were progressively developed in parallel to
                  the growing neocortical influence on motor

                  electrical self-stimulation, and drugs of abuse
                  suggest that midbrain dopamine systems are involved
                  in processing reward information and learning
                  approach behavior. Most dopamine neurons show phasic
                  activations after primary liquid and food rewards
                  and conditioned, reward-predicting visual and
                  auditory stimuli. They show biphasic,
                  activation-depression responses after stimuli that
                  resemble reward-predicting stimuli or are novel or
                  particularly salient. However, only few phasic
                  activations follow aversive stimuli. Thus dopamine
                  neurons label environmental stimuli with appetitive
                  value, predict and detect rewards and signal
                  alerting and motivating events. By failing to
                  discriminate between different rewards, dopamine
                  neurons appear to emit an alerting message about the
                  surprising presence or absence of rewards. All
                  responses to rewards and reward-predicting stimuli
                  depend on event predictability. Dopamine neurons are
                  activated by rewarding events that are better than
                  predicted, remain uninfluenced by events that are as
                  good as predicted, and are depressed by events that
                  are worse than predicted. By signaling rewards
                  according to a prediction error, dopamine responses
                  have the formal characteristics of a teaching signal
                  postulated by reinforcement learning
                  theories. Dopamine responses transfer during
                  learning from primary rewards to reward-predicting
                  stimuli. This may contribute to neuronal mechanisms
                  underlying the retrograde action of rewards, one of
                  the main puzzles in reinforcement learning. The
                  impulse response releases a short pulse of dopamine
                  onto many dendrites, thus broadcasting a rather
                  global reinforcement signal to postsynaptic
                  neurons. This signal may improve approach behavior
                  by providing advance reward information before the
                  behavior occurs, and may contribute to learning by
                  modifying synaptic transmission. The dopamine reward
                  signal is supplemented by activity in neurons in
                  striatum, frontal cortex, and amygdala, which
                  process specific reward information but do not emit
                  a global reward prediction error signal. A
                  cooperation between the different reward signals may
                  assure the use of specific rewards for selectively
                  reinforcing behaviors. Among the other projection
                  systems, noradrenaline neurons predominantly serve
                  attentional mechanisms and nucleus basalis neurons
                  code rewards heterogeneously. Cerebellar climbing
                  fibers signal errors in motor performance or errors
                  in the prediction of aversive events to cerebellar
                  Purkinje cells. Most deficits following
                  dopamine-depleting lesions are not easily explained
                  by a defective reward signal but may reflect the
                  absence of a general enabling function of tonic
                  levels of extracellular dopamine. Thus dopamine
                  systems may have two functions, the phasic
                  transmission of reward information and the tonic
                  enabling of postsynaptic neurons.}},

                  accumbens shell (AcbSh) elicits pronounced feeding
                  in satiated rats. This glutamate antagonist blocks
                  AMPA and kainate receptors and most likely increases
                  food intake by disrupting a tonic excitatory input
                  to the AcbSh, thus decreasing the firing rate of a
                  population of local neurons. Because the application
                  of GABA agonists also decreases neuronal activity,
                  we hypothesized that administration of GABA agonists
                  into the AcbSh would stimulate feeding in satiated
                  rats. We found that acute inhibition of cells in the

                  without altering water intake. Muscimol-induced
                  feeding was blocked by coadministration of the

                  not by the GABAB receptor blocker
                  saclofen. Conversely, baclofen-induced feeding was
                  blocked by coadministration of saclofen, but was not
                  affected by bicuculline. Furthermore, we found that
                  increasing local levels of GABA by administration of
                  a selective GABA-transaminase inhibitor,
                  gamma-vinyl-GABA, elicited robust feeding in
                  satiated rats, suggesting a physiological role for
                  endogenous AcbSh GABA in the control of feeding. A
                  mapping study showed that although some feeding can
                  be elicited by muscimol injections near the lateral

	abstract = {{This study investigated how the simulated response
                  of dopamine neurons to reward-related stimuli could
                  be used as reinforcement signal for learning a
                  spatial delayed response task. Spatial delayed
                  response tasks assess the functions of frontal
                  cortex and basal ganglia in short-term memory,
                  movement preparation and expectation of
                  environmental events. In these tasks, a stimulus
                  appears for a short period at a particular location,
                  and after a delay the subject moves to the location
                  indicated. Dopamine neurons are activated by
                  unpredicted rewards and reward-predicting stimuli,
                  are not influenced by fully predicted rewards, and
                  are depressed by omitted rewards. Thus, they appear
                  to report an error in the prediction of reward,
                  which is the crucial reinforcement term in formal
                  learning theories. Theoretical studies on
                  reinforcement learning have shown that signals
                  similar to dopamine responses can be used as
                  effective teaching signals for learning. A neural
                  network model implementing the temporal difference
                  algorithm was trained to perform a simulated spatial
                  delayed response task. The reinforcement signal was
                  modeled according to the basic characteristics of
                  dopamine responses to novel stimuli, primary rewards
                  and reward-predicting stimuli. A Critic component
                  analogous to dopamine neurons computed a temporal
                  error in the prediction of reinforcement and emitted
                  this signal to an Actor component which mediated the
                  behavioral output. The spatial delayed response task
                  was learned via two subtasks introducing spatial
                  choices and temporal delays, in the same manner as
                  monkeys in the laboratory. In all three tasks, the
                  reinforcement signal of the Critic developed in a
                  similar manner to the responses of natural dopamine
                  neurons in comparable learning situations, and the
                  learning curves of the Actor replicated the progress
                  of learning observed in the animals. Several
                  manipulations demonstrated further the efficacy of
                  the particular characteristics of the dopamine-like
                  reinforcement signal. Omission of reward induced a
                  phasic reduction of the reinforcement signal at the
                  time of the reward and led to extinction of learned
                  actions. A reinforcement signal without prediction
                  error resulted in impaired learning because of
                  perseverative errors. Loss of learned behavior was
                  seen with sustained reductions of the reinforcement
                  signal, a situation in general comparable to the
                  loss of dopamine innervation in Parkinsonian
                  patients and experimentally lesioned animals. The
                  striking similarities in teaching signals and
                  learning behavior between the computational and
                  biological results suggest that dopamine-like reward
                  responses may serve as effective teaching signals
                  for learning behavioral tasks that are typical for
                  primate cognitive behavior, such as spatial delayed
                  responding.}},

                  recordings in the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens
                  of rats performing in a plus maze. In all, 154 pairs
                  of cells (composed of 65 hippocampal and 56
                  accumbens neurons) were examined during the 1 s
                  period prior to reward delivery. Cross-correlation
                  analyses over a +/- 300-ms window with 10-ms bins
                  revealed that 108 pairs had at least one significant
                  histogram bin (P < 0.01). The most frequently
                  occurring peaks of hippocampal firing prior to
                  accumbens discharges appeared at latencies from
                  -30-0 ms, corresponding to published values of the
                  latency of the hippocampal pathway to the nucleus
                  accumbens. Other peaks appeared most often at
                  latencies multiples of about 110 ms prior to and
                  after this, corresponding to theta
                  rhythmicity. Since firing synchronization can result
                  from several types of connectivity patterns (such as
                  common inputs), a group of 18 hippocampus-accumbens
                  pairs was selected as those most likely to have
                  monosynaptic connections. The criterion was the
                  presence of at least one highly significant peak (P
                  < 0.001) at latencies corresponding to field
                  potentials evoked in the accumbens by hippocampal
                  stimulation. A significant peak occurred on all four
                  maze arms for only one of these cell pairs,
                  indicating positional modulation for the others. In
                  addition, behavior dependence of the synchrony
                  between these nucleus accumbens and hippocampus
                  neurons was examined by studying data in relation to
                  three different synchronization points: reward box
                  arrival, box departure, and arrival at the center of
                  the maze. This indicates that the functional
                  connectivity between hippocampal and accumbens
                  neurons was stronger when the rat was near reward
                  areas. Ten of the hippocampal neurons in these 18
                  cell pairs showed 9-Hz (theta) rhythmic activity in
                  autocorrelation analyses. Of these 10 cells,
                  cross-correlograms from eight hippocampal-accumbens
                  pairs also showed theta rhythmicity. Overall, these
                  results indicate that the synchrony between
                  hippocampus and nucleus accumbens neurons is
                  modulated by spatial position and behavior, and
                  theta rhythm may play an important role for this
                  synchronization.}},

                  in ventral tegmental area dopamine and metabolite
                  levels, and the percentage increase of dopamine was
                  higher in this region than in the nucleus
                  accumbens. Local perfusion with the dopamine uptake
                  inhibitor nomifensine (10 microM) increased dopamine
                  levels in the nucleus accumbens about three-fold and
                  potentiated the increase of dopamine levels induced
                  by self-stimulation. Nomifensine perfusion also
                  induced a delayed decrease in nucleus accumbens
                  glutamate levels, and self-stimulation did not
                  modify this effect of the drug. Local perfusion with
                  the D2-type dopamine receptor antagonist raclopride
                  significantly increased both basal and
                  self-stimulation induced dopamine release in the
                  nucleus accumbens. Neither nomifensine nor
                  raclopride perfusion significantly affected the
                  maximal rates of self-stimulation.Perfusion with
                  tetrodotoxin (2 microM) into nucleus accumbens
                  significantly decreased basal and prevented
                  stimulation-induced increases in accumbens dopamine
                  levels but only slightly decreased the rate of
                  self-stimulation. In contrast, perfusion of
                  tetrodotoxin (0.5 microM) into the ventral tegmental
                  area decreased basal and blocked stimulation-induced
                  increases in both nucleus accumbens and ventral
                  tegmental area dopamine levels; this treatment also
                  blocked or strongly inhibited
                  self-stimulation. While it had no effect on
                  glutamate levels in the nucleus accumbens, lateral
                  hypothalamic self-stimulation induced a significant
                  and tetrodotoxin-sensitive increase in glutamate
                  levels in the ventral tegmental area.Taken together,
                  the present results indicate that, across a broad
                  range of stimulation parameters, rewarding lateral
                  hypothalamus stimulation causes major and persistent
                  activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system, and
                  suggest descending glutamatergic fibers in the
                  medial forebrain bundle as a candidate for the
                  directly activated descending pathway in lateral
                  hypothalamus brain stimulation reward.}},

To help characterize the contribution of the LH to the expression of AcbSh-mediated feeding, we used the immunohistochemical detection of the nuclear protein Fos to determine whether inhibition of AcbSh cells results in an activation of LH neurons. Injections of the GABA(A) agonist muscimol into the AcbSh greatly increased the number of cells exhibiting Fos-like immunoreactivity in the LH, as well as in the lateral septum, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra pars compacta, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Blocking activation of LH neurons with the selective NMDA receptor blocker D(-)-AP-5 is known to suppress deprivation-induced feeding. We found that injections of D(-)-AP5 into the LH also dose-dependently suppressed AcbSh-mediated feeding. It is likely that inhibition of GABAergic neurons in the AcbSh is responsible for eliciting this feeding. If a behaviorally relevant GABAergic projection terminates in the LH, we should be able to mimic the effects seen after inhibition of the projection neurons by applying a GABA receptor blocker to the area. However, injections of the GABA(A) receptor blocker bicuculline or the GABA(B) receptor blocker saclofen did not significantly affect food intake. Thus, it appears that the expression of the feeding response depends on an NMDA-preferring receptor-mediated activation of LH neurons and is not the result of disinhibiting LH cells by disrupting transmission at GABA synapses.}},

            microinfusion of D-Ala(2),
            NMe-Phe(4),Glyol(5)-enkephalin. The microinjection mapping
            study demonstrated a broad anatomical gradient within the
            striatum, with sensitivity highest in relatively more
            lateral and ventral regions of the striatum (ventrolateral
            striatum, lateral shell and core). The Fos mapping study
            demonstrated that circuitry including hypothalamic areas,
            the ventral tegmental area, the substantia nigra and the
            nucleus of the solitary tract was recruited by stimulation
            of mu receptors within the nucleus accumbens. A similar
            pattern was observed following stimulation of mu receptors
            in the dorsal striatum; however, the extent of activation
            was much smaller in magnitude. These results suggest that
            the role of mu receptors within the striatum in palatable
            feeding primarily involves ventral and lateral
            regions. Moreover, the pattern of activation in
            hypothalamic, midbrain and gustatory-visceral relay areas
            suggests that striatal mu receptors may participate in
            integrating motivational, metabolic and autonomic aspects
            of ingestive behavior.}},

            endogenous opioid peptides in feeding behavior and, in
            particular, in the modulation of food reward and
            palatability. Since drugs such as heroin, morphine,
            alcohol, and cannabinoids, interact with this system,
            there may be important common neural substrates between
            food and drug reward with regard to the brain's opioid
            systems. In this paper, we review the proposed functional
            role of opioid neurotransmission and mu opiate receptors
            within the nucleus accumbens and surrounding ventral
            striatum. Opioid compounds, particularly those selective
            for the mu receptor, induce a potent increase in food
            intake, sucrose, salt, saccharin, and ethanol intake. We
            have explored this phenomenon with regard to macronutrient
            selection, regional specificity, role of output
            structures, Fos mapping, analysis of motivational state,
            and enkephalin gene expression. We hypothesize that
            opioid-mediated mechanisms within ventral striatal medium
            spiny neurons mediate the affective or hedonic response to
            food ('liking' or food 'pleasure'). A further refinement
            of this hypothesis is that activation of ventral striatal
            opioids specifically encodes positive affect induced by
            tasty and/or calorically dense foods (such as sugar and
            fat), and promotes behaviors associated with this enhanced
            palatability. It is proposed that this brain mechanism was
            beneficial in evolutionary development for ensuring the
            consumption of relatively scarce, high-energy food
            sources. However, in modern times, with unlimited supplies
            of high-calorie food, it has contributed to the present

            striatum, is best known for its prominent role in
            mediating the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse such
            as cocaine, alcohol, and nicotine. Indeed, it is generally
            believed that this structure subserves motivated
            behaviors, such as feeding, drinking, sexual behavior, and
            exploratory locomotion, which are elicited by natural
            rewards or incentive stimuli. A basic rule of positive
            reinforcement is that motor responses will increase in
            magnitude and vigor if followed by a rewarding event. It
            is likely, therefore, that the nucleus accumbens may serve
            as a substrate for reinforcement learning. However, there
            is surprisingly little information concerning the neural
            mechanisms by which appetitive responses are learned. In
            the present study, we report that treatment of the nucleus
            accumbens core with the selective competitive
            N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist
            2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5; 5 nmol/0.5 microl
            bilaterally) impairs response-reinforcement learning in
            the acquisition of a simple lever-press task to obtain
            food. Once the rats learned the task, AP-5 had no effect,
            demonstrating the requirement of NMDA receptor-dependent
            plasticity in the early stages of learning. Infusion of
            AP-5 into the accumbens shell produced a much smaller
            impairment of learning. Additional experiments showed that
            AP-5 core-treated rats had normal feeding and locomotor
            responses and were capable of acquiring stimulus-reward
            associations. We hypothesize that stimulation of NMDA
            receptors within the accumbens core is a key process
            through which motor responses become established in
            response to reinforcing stimuli. Further, this mechanism,
            may also play a critical role in the motivational and
            addictive properties of drugs of abuse.},

LTM requires de novo protein synthesis, and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) may be one of the transcription factors regulating the synthesis of new proteins necessary for the formation of LTM. Here we show that rats given massed fear conditioning training show no or weak LTM, as measured by fear-potentiated startle, compared with rats given the same amount of training but presented in a spaced manner. Increasing CREB levels specifically in the basolateral amygdala via viral vector-mediated gene transfer significantly increases LTM after massed fear training. The enhancing effect of CREB overexpression on LTM formation is shown to be specific in terms of biochemistry, anatomy, time course, and the training procedure used. These results suggest that CREB activity in the amygdala serves as a molecular switch for the formation of LTM in fear conditioning.}},

In contrast, chronic administration of several nonantidepressant psychotropic drugs did not influence expression of CREB mRNA, demonstrating the pharmacological specificity of this effect. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrates that antidepressant administration increases expression of CREB mRNA in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal and dentate gyrus granule cell layers of the hippocampus. In addition, levels of CRE immunoreactivity and of CRE binding activity were increased by chronic antidepressant administration, which indicates that expression and function of CREB protein are increased along with its mRNA. Chronic administration of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors rolipram or papaverine also increased expression of CREB mRNA in hippocampus, demonstrating a role for the cAMP cascade. Moreover, coadministration of rolipram with imipramine resulted in a more rapid induction of CREB than with either treatment alone. Increased expression and function of CREB suggest that specific target genes may be regulated by these treatments. We have found that levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and trkB mRNA are also increased by administration of antidepressants or PDE inhibitors. These findings indicate that upregulation of CREB is a common action of chronic antidepressant treatments that may lead to regulation of specific target genes, such as BDNF and trkB, and to the long-term effects of these treatments on brain function.}},

	abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that chronic morphine increases levels of the G-protein subunits Gia and Goa, adenylate cyclase, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, and certain phosphoproteins in the rat locus coeruleus, but not in several other brain regions studied, and that chronic morphine decreases levels of Gia and increases levels of adenylate cyclase in dorsal root ganglion/spinal cord (DRG-SC) co-cultures. These findings led us to survey the effects of chronic morphine on the G-protein/cyclic AMP system in a large number of brain regions to determine how widespread such regulation might be. We found that while most regions showed no regulation in response to chronic morphine, nucleus accumbens (NAc) and amygdala did show increases in adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity, and thalamus showed an increase in cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity only. An increase in cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity was also observed in DRG-SC co-cultures. Morphine regulation of G-proteins was variable, with decreased levels of Gia seen in the NAc, increased levels of Gia and Goa in amygdala, and no change in thalamus or the other brain regions studied. Interestingly, chronic treatment of rats with cocaine, but not with several non-abused drugs, produced similar changes compared to morphine in G-proteins, adenylate cyclase, and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in the NAc, but not in the other brain regions studied. These results indicate that regulation of the G-protein/cyclic AMP system represents a mechanism by which a number of opiate-sensitive neurons adapt to chronic morphine and thereby develop aspects of opiate tolerance and/or dependence. The findings that chronic morphine and cocaine produce similar adaptations in the NAc, a brain region important for the reinforcing actions of many types of abused substances, suggest further that common mechanisms may underlie psychological aspects of drug addiction mediated by this brain region.}},

The neural substrates of these drug effects remain unknown, but based on their prolonged time course, we hypothesize that they involve drug-induced alterations in gene expression. It has recently been demonstrated that amphetamine regulates the expression of several genes, including c-fos, via dopamine D1 receptors in rat striatum. Here we report that amphetamine induces phosphorylation of transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in rat striatum in vivo and that dopamine D1 receptor stimulation induces phosphorylation of CREB within specific complexes bound to cAMP regulatory elements. In addition, we show by antisense injection that CREB is necessary for c-fos induction by amphetamine in vivo. Since CREB has been implicated in the activation of a number of immediate-early genes as well as several neuropeptide genes, CREB phosphorylation may be an important early nuclear event mediating long-term consequences of amphetamine administration.}},

Treatment with d-amphetamine (5 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days produced behavioral sensitization. Similar to previous observations using chronic cocaine administration, amphetamine sensitized animals had decreased c-Fos and increased FRA proteins in striatum. Supershift analysis with antisera to c-Fos and FRA proteins demonstrated that 4-Fos and the 35 kDa FRA are components of the striatal AP-1 binding complex from sensitized rats. Thus, amphetamine sensitization is accompanied by alterations in the composition of the AP-1 DNA binding complex. An increased amount of phosphoCREB protein was also present in the striatum of amphetamine sensitized rats. These results suggest that alterations in Fos, FRA and CREB transcription factors are common neuronal responses to chronic psychostimulant administration and may contribute to regulation of genes important to the neuroplastic changes underlying psychostimulant sensitization.}},

To explore how regulation of CREB in the NAc affects behavior, we used herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors to elevate CREB expression in this region or to overexpress a dominant-negative mutant CREB (mCREB) that blocks CREB function. Rats treated with HSV-mCREB in place conditioning studies spent more time in environments associated with cocaine, indicating increased cocaine reward. Conversely, rats treated with HSV-CREB spent less time in cocaine-associated environments, indicating increased cocaine aversion. Studies in which drug-environment pairings were varied to coincide with either the early or late effects of cocaine suggest that CREB-associated place aversions reflect increased cocaine withdrawal. Because cocaine withdrawal can be accompanied by symptoms of depression, we examined how altered CREB function in the NAc affects behavior in the forced swim test (FST). Elevated CREB expression increased immobility in the FST, an effect that is opposite to that caused by standard antidepressants and is consistent with a link between CREB and dysphoria. Conversely, overexpression of mCREB decreased immobility, an effect similar to that caused by antidepressants. Moreover, the kappa opioid receptor antagonist nor-Binaltorphimine decreased immobility in HSV-CREB- and HSV-mCREB-treated rats, suggesting that CREB-mediated induction of dynorphin (an endogenous kappa receptor ligand) contributes to immobility behavior in the FST. Exposure to the FST itself dramatically increased CREB function in the NAc. These findings raise the possibility that CREB-mediated transcription within the NAc regulates dysphoric states.}},

performed a regional and cellular mapping of beta-galactosidase
(beta-gal) expression during naltrexone-precipitated

expression increased in the LC, but decreased in the lateral ventral

withdrawal increased beta-gal expression in the continuum of the
extended amygdala and nucleus accumbens, macrostructures associated
with the coupling of emotional stimuli to motor and autonomic
responses. At the cellular level, in the central nucleus of the
amygdala, beta-gal was found in cells both with and without mu opioid
receptors as well as in corticotropin-releasing factor-expressing
cells. In nucleus accumbens, beta-gal was expressed in several major
subpopulations of neurons. In LC, beta-gal expression was induced
predominantly in tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing cells, whereas in the
VTA and DRN the majority of cells expressing beta-gal were
nonmonoaminergic. These results show that molecular adaptations to
chronic morphine alter CRE-mediated transcription during opiate
withdrawal in physiologically salient regions involved in arousal,

during withdrawal. CRE-mediated transcription may itself contribute to
re-establishing homeostasis in the organism through target gene

This study tested PKA involvement in cocaine self-administration and relapse of cocaine-seeking behavior by infusing cAMP analogs that activate or inhibit PKA into the NAc of rats. Bilateral intra-NAc infusions of the PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMPS reduced baseline cocaine self-administration, shifted the dose-response curve for cocaine self-administration to the left, and induced relapse of cocaine-seeking behavior after extinction from cocaine self-administration, consistent with an enhancement of cocaine effects in each paradigm. In contrast, pretreatment with intra-NAc infusions of a PKA activator, Sp-cAMPS or dibutyryl cAMP, increased baseline cocaine self-administration during the second hour of testing and shifted the dose-response curve to the right, consistent with an antagonist-like action. After extinction from cocaine self-administration, similar infusions of Sp-cAMPS induced generalized responding at both drug-paired and inactive levers. As an index of PKA activity in vivo, NAc infusions of Rp-cAMPS reduced basal levels of dopamine-regulated phosphoprotein-32 phosphorylation and blocked amphetamine-induced increases in cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. Conversely, NAc infusions of Sp-cAMPS increased phosphorylation of CREB. Together, these results suggest that sustained upregulation of the cAMP system in the NAc after repeated cocaine exposure could underlie tolerance to cocaine reinforcement, whereas acute inhibition of this system may contribute to drug craving and relapse in addicted subjects.}},

	abstract = {{This paper presents a biopsychological theory of drug addiction, the 'Incentive-Sensitization Theory'. The theory addresses three fundamental questions. The first is: why do addicts crave drugs? That is, what is the psychological and neurobiological basis of drug craving? The second is: why does drug craving persist even after long periods of abstinence? The third is whether 'wanting' drugs (drug craving) is attributable to 'liking' drugs (to the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs)? The theory posits the following. (1) Addictive drugs share the ability to enhance mesotelencephalic dopamine neurotransmission. (2) One psychological function of this neural system is to attribute 'incentive salience' to the perception and mental representation of events associated with activation of the system. Incentive salience is a psychological process that transforms the perception of stimuli, imbuing them with salience, making them attractive, 'wanted', incentive stimuli. (3) In some individuals the repeated use of addictive drugs produces incremental neuroadaptations in this neural system, rendering it increasingly and perhaps permanently, hypersensitive ('sensitized') to drugs and drug-associated stimuli. The sensitization of dopamine systems is gated by associative learning, which causes excessive incentive salience to be attributed to the act of drug taking and to stimuli associated with drug taking. It is specifically the sensitization of incentive salience, therefore, that transforms ordinary 'wanting' into excessive drug craving. (4) It is further proposed that sensitization of the neural systems responsible for incentive salience ('for wanting') can occur independently of changes in neural systems that mediate the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs (drug 'liking') and of neural systems that mediate withdrawal. Thus, sensitization of incentive salience can produce addictive behavior (compulsive drug seeking and drug taking) even if the expectation of drug pleasure or the aversive properties of withdrawal are diminished and even in the face of strong disincentives, including the loss of reputation, job, home and family. We review evidence for this view of addiction and discuss its implications for understanding the psychology and neurobiology of addiction.}},

Studies in patients with posttraumatic stress syndrome indicate these individuals seem to show normal fear reactions but abnormal anxiety measured with the acoustic startle reflex. Studies in rats, also using the startle reflex, indicate that highly processed explicit cue information (lights, tones, touch) activates the central nucleus of the amygdala, which in turn activates hypothalamic and brain stem target areas involved in specific signs of fear. Somewhat less explicit information, such as that produced by exposure to a threating environment for several minutes or by intraventricular administration of the peptide corticotropin-releasing hormone may activate a brain area closely related to the amygdala, called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, which in turn activates hypothalamic and brain stem target areas involved in specific signs of fear or anxiety. Because the nature of this information may be less specific than that produced by an explicit cue, and of much longer duration, activation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis may be more akin to anxiety than to fear.}},

We found that intense noxious stimuli (i.e., subdermal injection of capsaicin or paw immersion in hot water) induced profound attenuation of the jaw-opening reflex in the anesthetized rat; forepaw subdermal capsaicin also elevated the mechanical hindpaw-withdrawal threshold in the awake rat. These antinociceptive effects were blocked by previous injection of either a dopamine antagonist (flupentixol) or an opioid antagonist (naloxone) into the nucleus accumbens. Additional experiments in anesthetized animals showed that the antinociceptive effect of noxious stimulation by either capsaicin (>/=100 micrograms) or hindpaw immersion in hot water (>/=45 degrees C for 4 min) correlated with the intensity of the stimulus. The maximal antinociceptive effect of capsaicin was similar in magnitude to that of a high dose of morphine (10 mg/kg) injected subcutaneously. Injection of the GABA(A)-receptor agonist muscimol, but not naloxone, into the rostroventral medulla, a major component of descending pain modulation systems, blocked capsaicin-induced antinociception. Although it is widely thought that painful stimuli may induce analgesia by activating forebrain structures, this is the first demonstration that such a mechanism exists. Furthermore, this mechanism can be engaged by naturalistic stimuli in awake animals. These observations imply that painful stimuli might under certain conditions be rewarding.}},

Recent studies suggest that the activation of mesolimbic dopamine (DA) neurons, arising from the cell bodies of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), plays an important role in mediating the suppression of tonic pain.

Addiction is presented as a cycle of spiralling dysregulation of brain reward systems that progressively increases, resulting in the compulsive use and loss of control over drug-taking. The development of addiction recruits different sources of reinforcement, different neuroadaptive mechanisms, and different neurochemical changes to dysregulate the brain reward system. Counteradaptive processes such as opponent-process that are part of normal homeostatic limitation of reward function fail to return within the normal homeostatic range and are hypothesized to form an allostatic state. Allostasis from the addiction perspective is defined as the process of maintaining apparent reward function stability by changes in brain reward mechanisms. The allostatic state represents a chronic deviation of reward set point and is fueled not only by dysregulation of reward circuits per se, but also by the activation of brain and hormonal stress responses. The manifestation of this allostatic state as compulsive drug-taking and loss of control over drug-taking is hypothesized to be expressed through activation of brain circuits involved in compulsive behavior such as the cortico-striatal-thalamic loop. The view that addiction is the pathology that results from an allostatic mechanism using the circuits established for natural rewards provides a realistic approach to identifying the neurobiological factors that produce vulnerability to addiction and relapse.}},

The present article reviews evidence implicating the mesoaccumbens dopamine projection in sexual behaviors and discusses some of the issues that have contributed to the uncertainty over the exact role of this system in these and other species typical behaviors.

In this report we show, by means of in vivo microdialysis and Fos immunohistochemistry, that the hyper-responsiveness which characterizes the dopaminergic transmission to the shell is dependent on glucocorticoid hormones. In Sprague-Dawley rats, after suppression of endogenous glucocorticoids by adrenalectomy, extracellular dopamine levels selectively decreased in the shell, whilst they remained unchanged in the core. This effect was observed in basal conditions, after a mild stress (vehicle injection), as well as after subcutaneous administration of morphine (2 mg/kg, s.c. ) or intraperitoneal injection of cocaine (15 mg/kg, i.p.). The decrease in dopamine observed in the shell had a postsynaptic impact, as shown by less induction of Fos-like proteins selectively in the shell in response to cocaine. However, the induction of Fos-like proteins by the full D1 agonist SKF82958 (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) remained unchanged after adrenalectomy, suggesting that the changes in Fos expression after cocaine injection were likely to depend on changes in extracellular dopamine levels rather than on changes in postsynaptic sensitivity to dopamine. The effects of adrenalectomy were glucocorticoid-specific given that they were prevented by corticosterone treatment. This anatomical specificity in the control of neuronal activity by a hormonal input highlights the role of steroid hormones in shaping the functional activity of the brain.},

In this study we compared the responses of these three regions to mild stress and drugs of abuse by measuring extracellular dopamine (DA) concentrations and Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-LI). The results are summarrized as follows. (i) In unchallenged conditions, extracellular DA concentrations were highest in the dorsolateral striatum and lowest in the core, whereas Fos-LI was highest in the shell and lowest in the dorsolateral striatum. (ii) After challenges that increase DA by depolarizing DAergic neurons (injection stress or 2 mg/kg morphine), the shell presented the largest increase in DA levels and Fos-LI. (iii) After the administration of a DA-uptake blocker (15 mg/kg cocaine), the percentage increase in DA was still largest in the shell. However, the absolute increase in DA and Fos-LI in the shell and the dorsolateral striatum were similar. (iv) After a full D1 agonist (SKF82958), Fos-LI was highest in the shell and lowest in the dorsolateral striatum. In conclusion, the nucleus accumbens shell seems to be the area of the striatal complex most functionally reactive to stress and drugs of abuse.

Dopamine is recognized as the transmitter of one such neural pathway, being involved in at least three major aspects of motivation: modulation of motivational state, acquisition (incentive learning) and expression of incentive properties by motivational stimuli. Drugs of abuse of different pharmacological classes stimulate in the low dose range dopamine transmission particularly in the ventral striatum. Apart from psychostimulants, the evidence that stimulation of dopamine transmission by drugs of abuse provides the primary motivational stimulus for drug self-administration is either unconvincing or negative. However, stimulation of dopamine transmission is essential for the activational properties of drugs of abuse and might be instrumental for the acquisition of responding to drug-related incentive stimuli (incentive learning). Dopamine is involved in the induction and in the expression of behavioural sensitization by repeated exposure to various drugs of abuse. Sensitization to the dopamine-stimulant properties of specific drug classes leading to facilitation of incentive learning of drug-related stimuli might account for the strong control over behaviour exerted by these stimuli in the addiction state. Withdrawal from drugs of abuse results in a reduction in basal dopamine transmission in vivo and in reduced responding for conventional reinforcers. Although these changes are likely to be the expression of a state of dependence of the dopamine system their contribution to the motivational state of drug addiction is unclear.}},

No significant impairment of CTA was obtained after administration of the specific D(2)/D(3) antagonist raclopride (100 and 300 microg/kg, s.c.). The ability of SCH 23390 to impair CTA learning was confirmed by its ability to reduce the conditional aversive reactions to a gustatory CS (sweet chocolate) as estimated in a taste reactivity paradigm. SCH 39166 impaired CTA also when infused in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell 5 min after the CS. No impairment was obtained from the NAc core or from the bed nucleus stria terminalis. The results indicate that D(1) receptor blockade impairs CTA learning by disrupting the formation of a short-term memory trace of the gustatory CS and that endogenous dopamine acting on D(1) receptors in the NAc shell plays a role in short-term memory processes related to associative gustatory learning.}},

Defensive treading elicited by caudal shell muscimol microinjection appeared to be a negative motivated response to threat (similar in parameters and orientation to normal defensive burying of a threatening electrified shock prod). The nucleus accumbens shell thus appears functionally heterogeneous in coding motivational valence. The demonstration that muscimol elicits positive eating behavior from rostral shell versus negative defensive behavior from caudal shell suggests in particular that GABAergic substrates of positive and negative types of motivated behavior in the nucleus accumbens shell are segregated along a rostrocaudal gradient.}},

Originally studied in human infants, affective reactions to taste have also been used by affective neuroscience to identify hedonic brain systems in studies of animals (via application of neural stimulation, pharmacological activation, and neural lesion manipulations). The chief limitation of measuring affective reactions is that it is difficult for experimenters to know how to interpret them, and therefore how to interpret changes produced by brain manipulations. This paper notes guidelines to interpretation. It examines the phylogenetic continuity between humans, other primates, and rats in terms of the microstructure of taste-elicited affective reactions. It reviews evidence that affective taste reactivity patterns truly reflect a 'core hedonic process' of palatability or affect, rather than being an ingestion measure, consummatory behavior measure, or a sensory reflex measure. It reviews affective neuroscience studies of taste reactivity that have identified true hedonic brain substrates, and discriminated them from false hedonic brain substrates. It considers the neural bases of incentive 'wanting' versus 'liking'. Finally, it notes the difference between human subjective affective ratings of pleasure and 'core hedonic processes' reflected by behavioral affective reactions.}},

Drugs of abuse activate CREB in the nucleus accumbens, an important part of the brain's reward pathways, and local manipulations of CREB activity have been shown to affect cocaine reward, suggesting an active role of CREB in adaptive processes that follow exposure to drugs of abuse. Using CRE-LacZ reporter mice, we show that not only rewarding stimuli such as morphine, but also aversive stimuli such as stress, activate CRE-mediated transcription in the nucleus accumbens shell. Using viral-mediated gene transfer to locally alter the activity of CREB, we show that this manipulation affects morphine reward, as well as the preference for sucrose, a more natural reward. We then show that local changes in CREB activity induce a more general syndrome, by altering reactions to anxiogenic, aversive, and nociceptive stimuli as well. Increased CREB activity in the nucleus accumbens shell decreases an animal's responses to each of these stimuli, whereas decreased CREB activity induces an opposite phenotype. These results show that environmental stimuli regulate CRE-mediated transcription within the nucleus accumbens shell, and that changes in CREB activity within this brain area subsequently alter gating between emotional stimuli and their behavioral responses. This control appears to be independent of the intrinsic appetitive or aversive value of the stimulus. The potential relevance of these data to addiction and mood disorders is discussed.}},

Within the Acb of rats, a peripherally located shell and a centrally situated core can be recognized that have different connectional, neurochemical, and functional identities. Although the Acb core resembles in many respects the dorsally adjacent caudate-putamen complex in its striatal character, the Acb shell has, in addition to striatal features, a more diverse array of neurochemical characteristics, and afferent and efferent connections. Inputs and outputs of the Acb, in particular of the shell, are inhomogeneously distributed, resulting in a mosaical arrangement of concentrations of afferent fibers and terminals and clusters of output neurons. To determine the precise relationships between the distributional patterns of various afferents (e.g., from the prefrontal cortex, the basal amygdaloid complex, the hippocampal formation, and the midline/intralaminar thalamic nuclei) and efferents to the ventral pallidum and mesencephalon, neuroanatomical anterograde and retrograde tracing experiments were carried out. The results of the double anterograde, double retrograde, and anterograde/retrograde tracing experiments indicate that various parts of the shell (dorsomedial, ventromedial, ventral, and lateral) and the core (medial and lateral) have different input-output characteristics. Furthermore, within these Acb regions, various populations of neurons can be identified, arranged in a cluster-like fashion, onto which specific sets of afferents converge and that project to particular output stations, distinct from the input-output relationships of neighboring, cluster-like neuronal populations. These results support the idea that the nucleus accumbens may consist of a collection of neuronal ensembles with different input-output relationships and, presumably, different functional characteristics.}},

Do they mediate hedonic reward learning and associative prediction? Our review of the literature, together with results of a new study of residual reward capacity after dopamine depletion, indicates the answer to both questions is 'no'. Rather, dopamine systems may mediate the incentive salience of rewards, modulating their motivational value in a manner separable from hedonia and reward learning. In a study of the consequences of dopamine loss, rats were depleted of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and neostriatum by up to 99\% using 6-hydroxydopamine. In a series of experiments, we applied the 'taste reactivity' measure of affective reactions (gapes, etc.) to assess the capacity of dopamine-depleted rats for: 1) normal affect (hedonic and aversive reactions), 2) modulation of hedonic affect by associative learning (taste aversion conditioning), and 3) hedonic enhancement of affect by non-dopaminergic pharmacological manipulation of palatability (benzodiazepine administration). We found normal hedonic reaction patterns to sucrose vs. quinine, normal learning of new hedonic stimulus values (a change in palatability based on predictive relations), and normal pharmacological hedonic enhancement of palatability. We discuss these results in the context of hypotheses and data concerning the role of dopamine in reward. We review neurochemical, electrophysiological, and other behavioral evidence. We conclude that dopamine systems are not needed either to mediate the hedonic pleasure of reinforcers or to mediate predictive associations involved in hedonic reward learning. We conclude instead that dopamine may be more important to incentive salience attributions to the neural representations of reward-related stimuli. Incentive salience, we suggest, is a distinct component of motivation and reward. In other words, dopamine systems are necessary for 'wanting' incentives, but not for 'liking' them or for learning new 'likes' and 'dislikes'.}},

Much of the support for this conclusion was obtained from studies utilizing lesions or drugs to manipulate aspects of central dopaminergic function. Although such experiments yield important information concerning the behavioral consequences of interference with DA systems in brain, they do not demonstrate any relation between the dynamic activity of DA neurons and the level or type of motor function exhibited by the organism. This review discusses the emerging field of behavioral neurochemistry, and provides an overview of recent studies investigating the relation between nucleus accumbens DA release and behavior. Particular emphasis is placed upon current research involving microdialysis, voltammetry and electrophysiology. These different methods are viewed as complementary techniques for investigating the activity of DA systems in behaving animals. Evidence indicates that DA activity is most reliably activated by stimuli that trigger instrumental behavior and during the preparatory or instrumental phase of motivated behavior. The effects of consummatory reactions to positive reinforcers are somewhat equivocal; with food consumption, dialysis studies have yielded inconsistent results, while some voltammetric and electrophysiological studies have shown that DA activity in accumbens or ventral tegmental area actually decreases during consumption of food reinforcement. Moreover, the responsiveness of accumbens DA activity during behavioral stimulation is not unique to appetitive conditions, as several studies have shown that aversive or stressful conditions also stimulate accumbens DA release or metabolism. It is reasonable to suggest at this time that accumbens DA neurons are activated by a variety of different motivational conditions, but that the consequence of that activation is to modulate the behavioral reactivity of the organism. This type of function is seen as representing an area of overlap between motor and motivational processes.}},

This property undergoes one-trial habituation consistent with a role of nucleus accumbens shell dopamine in associative learning. Experimental studies with place- and taste-conditioning paradigms confirm this role. Addictive drugs share with conventional reinforcers the property of stimulating dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens shell. This response, however, undergoes one-trial habituation in the case of conventional reinforcers but not of drugs. Resistance to habituation allows drugs to repetitively activate dopamine transmission in the shell upon repeated self-administration. This process abnormally facilitates associative learning, leading to the attribution of excessive motivational value to discrete stimuli or contexts predictive of drug availability. Addiction is therefore the expression of the excessive control over behavior acquired by drug-related stimuli as a result of abnormal strenghtening of stimulus-drug contingencies by nondecremental drug-induced stimulation of dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens shell.}},

The addictive effects of various drugs depend on the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system innervating the nucleus accumbens. We used single-unit recording in rats to test whether accumbens neurons exhibit responses to a discriminative stimulus (SD) tone previously paired with cocaine availability during cocaine self-administration. Presentation of the tone after 3-4 weeks of abstinence resulted in a cue-induced relapse of drug seeking under extinction conditions. Accumbens neurons did not exhibit tone-evoked activity before cocaine self-administration training but exhibited significant SD tone-evoked activity during extinction. Under extinction conditions, shell neurons exhibited significantly greater activity evoked by the SD tone than that evoked by a neutral tone (i.e., never paired with reinforcement). In contrast, core neurons responded indiscriminately to presentations of the SD tone or the neutral tone. Accumbens shell neurons exhibited significantly greater SD tone-evoked activity than did accumbens core neurons. Although the onset of SD tone-evoked activity occurred well before the earliest movements commenced (150 msec), this activity often persisted beyond the onset of tone-evoked movements. These results indicate that accumbens shell neurons exhibit persistent processing of information regarding reward-related stimuli after prolonged drug abstinence. Moreover, the accumbens shell appears to be involved in discriminating the motivational value of reward-related associative stimuli, whereas the accumbens core does not.}},

The functions of the NAcc core and shell were investigated in mediating amphetamine-potentiated conditioned reinforcement and locomotion. Rats were initially trained to associate a neutral stimulus (Pavlovian CS) with food reinforcement (US). After excitotoxic lesions that selectively destroyed either the NAcc core or shell, animals underwent additional CS-US training sessions and then were tested for the acquisition of a new instrumental response that produced the CS acting as a conditioned reinforcer (CR). Animals were infused intra-NAcc with D-amphetamine (0, 1, 3, 10, or 20 microg) before each session. Shell lesions affected neither Pavlovian nor instrumental conditioning but completely abolished the potentiative effect of intra-NAcc amphetamine on responding with CR. Core-lesioned animals were impaired during the Pavlovian retraining sessions but showed no deficit in the acquisition of responding with CR. However, the selectivity in stimulant-induced potentiation of the CR lever was reduced, as intra-NAcc amphetamine infusions dose-dependently increased responding on both the CR lever and a nonreinforced (control) lever. Shell lesions produced hypoactivity and attenuated amphetamine-induced activity. In contrast, core lesions resulted in hyperactivity and enhanced the locomotor-stimulating effect of amphetamine. These results indicate a functional dissociation of subregions of the NAcc; the shell is a critical site for stimulant effects underlying the enhancement of responding with CR and locomotion after intra-NAcc injections of amphetamine, whereas the core is implicated in mechanisms underlying the expression of CS-US associations.}},

Rats were food deprived and trained to press two levers, one delivering food pellets and the other a sucrose solution. All animals acquired the lever-press response although the rate of acquisition and overall response rates in core-lesioned animals were depressed relative to that in the shell- or sham-lesioned animals. Furthermore, in shell- and sham-lesioned rats, post-training devaluation of one of the two outcomes using a specific satiety procedure produced a selective reduction in performance on the lever that, in training, delivered the prefed outcome. In contrast, the core-lesioned rats failed to show a selective devaluation effect and reduced responding on both levers. Subsequent tests revealed that these effects of core lesions were not caused by an impairment in their ability to recall the devalued outcome, to discriminate the two outcomes, or to encode the instrumental action-outcome contingencies to which they were exposed. Additionally, the core lesions did not have any marked effect on Pavlovian conditioning or on Pavlovian-instrumental transfer. Importantly, although shell-lesioned rats showed no deficit in any test of instrumental conditioning or in Pavlovian conditioning, they failed to show any positive transfer in the Pavlovian-instrumental transfer test. This double dissociation suggests that nucleus accumbens core and shell differentially mediate the impact of instrumental and Pavlovian incentive processes, respectively, on instrumental performance.}},

Each drug was ineffective or markedly less effective when injected at a slightly more dorsal and lateral site in the core of nucleus accumbens. Self-administration of PCP, MK-801, or CPP directly into nucleus accumbens was not altered by co-infusion of a dose of the dopamine antagonist sulpiride that effectively blocked intracranial self-administration of the dopamine uptake inhibitor nomifensine, suggesting that the rewarding actions of the NMDA receptor antagonists are not dopamine-dependent. Rats also developed lever-pressing habits when PCP, MK-801, and CPP were each microinjected directly into frontal cortex, a region previously associated with the rewarding actions of cocaine but not nomifensine. Thus nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex are each potential substrates for the rewarding properties of PCP and related drugs, and the ability of these drugs to disrupt NMDA receptor function seems sufficient to account for their rewarding actions. When considered with independent evidence, the present results suggest a model of drug reward within which the critical event is inhibition of medium spiny neurons in nucleus accumbens.}},

We have demonstrated previously that this treatment activates a number of brain regions, most significantly the lateral hypothalamus (LH). This activation could be elicited through a direct neural connection with the AcbSh or secondarily through changes in autonomic activity, stress, or circulating levels of orexigenic or satiety factors. In the present study, we used the immunohistochemical localization of Fos protein to map neuronal activation after unilateral muscimol injections into the AcbSh to determine whether AcbSh-mediated Fos expression remains lateralized in the circuit and whether secondary systemic changes in the rat can be excluded as primary factors in the activation of downstream component nuclei. Rats receiving only saline injections exhibited very little Fos immunoreactivity. In contrast, unilateral injections of muscimol into the AcbSh consistently increased Fos expression in several brain regions. Three distinct patterns of expression were observed. Fos synthesis in the LH was increased only on the side of the brain ipsilateral to the muscimol injection. Fos expression remained primarily ipsilateral to the injection site in the septohypothalamic, paraventricular hypothalamic (PVN), paratenial thalamic, and lateral habenular nuclei, and medial substantia nigra, but was increased bilaterally in the piriform cortex, supraoptic nucleus, central nucleus of the amygdala, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Smaller numbers of Fos-immunoreactive cells were seen unilaterally in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial ventral pallidum, arcuate nucleus, and ventral tegmental area and bilaterally in the supraoptic and tuberomammillary nuclei. The labeling in the LH, PVN, and other unilaterally labeled structures provides evidence that these brain regions are components of an AcbSh-mediated neural circuit and suggests that they may be involved in the expression of AcbSh-mediated feeding behavior.}},

The dependence of these correlates upon the presence of a reward was studied by comparing the behavioral correlates observed when the presence of the reward was manipulated within a single behavioral session. Rats were well-trained on a continuous reinforcement instrumental task reinforced by 0.1 ml drops of 5\% sucrose. Extracellular single-unit neural activity was recorded from electrode arrays implanted into the NAC when instrumental behavior was and then was not reinforced with sucrose (within-session extinction). A variable delay between the instrumental response and the sucrose delivery allowed for separation of neural activity related to these task events. A spike activity increase around the time of the instrumental response was the most common behavioral correlate, while a decrease in spike activity upon sucrose delivery was the second most common behavioral correlate. Following removal of the reinforcer, subjects continued to perform the instrumental response, allowing for the examination of response-related spike activity under extinction conditions in which the response was no longer reinforced by sucrose. A majority of the response-related neural activity patterns were lost when sucrose was no longer available. New neural responses also were detected during this period. For some subjects, the reinforcer was again made available during the same session. Encoding of the primary behavioral events during this period of reinstated reinforcer was similar, but not identical, to that observed during the first period of reinforced responding. These findings reveal that instrumental task-associated spike activity within the NAC is partially dependent upon the presence of the reinforcer, and that encoding across the population is distinct under reinforced and extinction conditions.}},

There appears to be functional interdigitation between these two groups, which both have extensive projections. The principal ascending connections are with thalamic nuclei and structures associated with the striatum, including the substantial nigra pars compacta. The descending connections are with a variety of nuclei in the pons, medulla and spinal cord, concerned with autonomic and motor functions. In the past, emphasis has been laid on the role of the PPTg in locomotion and behavioural state control. In this review, we emphasise the role of the PPTg in processing outputs from the striatum. The non-cholinergic neurons receive outflow from both dorsal and vental striatum, and lesions of the PPTg disrupt behaviour associated with each of these. Our review indicates that the PPTg is less concerned with the induction of locomotion and more concerned with relating reinforcement (information about which comes from the ventral striatum) with motor output from the dorsal striatum. The conclusions we draw are: (1) the PPTg is an outflow system for the striatum, but also forms a 'subsidiary circuit', returning information to striatal circuitry; in this, the PPTg has an anatomical organisation that resembles that of the substantia nigra. (2) As well as a role in the mediation of REM sleep, cholinergic PPTg neurons have an important role in the waking state, providing feedback into the thalamus and striatum. (3) The precise function of the computations performed on striatal outflow by the PPTg is uncertain. We discuss whether this function is complementary (parallel to other routes of striatal outflow), integrative (modifying other forms of striatal outflow) or both.}},

In the telencephalon, ventral pallidal fibers reach the prefrontal cortex, the ventral striatum, the lateral septum, the basolateral, lateral, and central amygdaloid nuclei, and the lateral entorhinal area.

The results of the experiments in which retrograde tracers were injected in different nuclei in the mesencephalon allow the distinction of two main areas in the ventral pallidum.

Four separate populations of hypothalamic neurons, which constitute a major source of diffuse cortical innervation, were identified: Tuberal lateral hypothalamic (LHAt) neurons which innervate the cerebral cortex tend to cluster in the perifornical region, in the zona incerta, and along the medial edge of the cerebral peduncle, at levels roughly coextensive with the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. Most of these neurons project to the ipsilateral cortex; a small percentage innervate the contralateral cortex, but this varies among cortical terminal fields. The perifornical neurons are organized in a roughly topographic medial-to-lateral relationship with respect to their cortical terminal fields. Field of Forel (FF) neurons, which project primarily to the frontal cortex of the ipsilateral hemisphere, are located just ventral to the medial edge of the medial lemniscus, at the level of the ventromedial basal thalamic nucleus. The more laterally placed neurons innervate the lateral frontal, insular and perirhinal cortex; the more medial neurons, around the mammillothalamic tract, innervate the medial frontopolar, prelimbic, infralimbic, and anterior cingulate cortex. Posterior lateral hypothalamic (LHAp) neurons form a dense cluster spanning the lateral hypothalamus, from the cerebral peduncle to the posterior hypothalamic area at premammillary levels, and extending into the supramammillary nucleus and the adjacent ventral tegmental area. LHAp neurons innervate the entire cerebral cortex, predominantly on the ipsilateral side. Populations of LHAp neurons projecting to different cortical target areas show considerable spatial overlap, but computer plots of the centers of these populations demonstrate a strict topographic relationship with respect to the cerebral cortex. Tuberomammillary (TMN) neurons form a sheet along the ventrolateral surface of the premammillary hypothalamus. About twice as many TMN neurons innervate the ipsilateral, as compared to the contralateral hemisphere; it is not known whether single neurons project to both hemispheres. No topographic organization of the TMN cortical projection is apparent. Injections of different-colored fluorescent dyes into various cortical areas demonstrate that hypothalamic neurons in general have rather restricted cortical terminal fields. Only occasional neurons are found, primarily in LHAt, which are double labeled by injections into different cytoarchitectonic areas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)}},

LI is considered to index the capacity to ignore irrelevant stimuli and its disruption has recently received increasing interest as an animal model of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Initial studies indicated that LI is disrupted by systemic or intra-accumbens injections of amphetamine and hippocampal lesions, and potentiated by systemic administration of neuroleptics. On the basis of these findings, the switching model of LI proposed that LI depends on the subicular input to the nucleus accumbens (NAC). Subsequent studies supported and refined this proposition. Lesion studies show that LI is indeed disrupted by severing the subicular input to the NAC, and further implicate the entorhinal/ventral subicular portion of this pathway projecting to the shell subterritory of the NAC. There is a functional dissociation between the shell and core subterritories of the NAC, with lesions of the former but not of the latter disrupting LI. This suggests that the shell is necessary for the expression and the core for the disruption of LI. The involvement of the NAC has been also demonstrated by findings that LI is disrupted by intra-accumbens injection of amphetamine and potentiated by DA depletion or blockade in this structure. Disruption and potentiation of LI by systemic administration of amphetamine and neuroleptics, respectively, have been firmly established, and in addition, have been shown to be sensitive to parametric manipulations of the LI procedure. LI is unaffected by lesions and DA manipulations of medial prefrontal cortex and lesions of basolateral amygdala. The implications of these findings for LI as an animal model of schizophrenia are discussed.}},

Both patterns have a nonhomogeneous, patch-like appearance throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the nucleus and show a good, mutual correspondence. In the core of the nucleus accumbens as well as in the border region between the nucleus accumbens and the caudate-putamen, leu-enkephalin-rich areas are in register with opioid receptor-dense areas. In the shell region the precise relationship between the enkephalin and the naloxone patterns could not be established. A comparison of the connectivity patterns and neurochemical characteristics of the opioid receptor-dense compartments in the nucleus accumbens with those in the caudate-putamen reveals major discrepancies between these two striatal subdivisions. We therefore conclude that, rather than a bicompartmental patch/striosome-matrix organization, the nucleus accumbens has a multicompartmental organization.}},

Of these brain regions, the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc) play central roles in the processing of rewarding environmental stimuli and in drug addiction. The psychoactive properties of marijuana are mediated by the active constituent, Delta(9)-THC, interacting primarily with CB1 cannabinoid receptors in a large number of brain areas. However, it is the activation of these receptors located within the central brain reward circuits that is thought to play an important role in sustaining the self-administration of marijuana in humans, and in mediating the anxiolytic and pleasurable effects of the drug. Here we describe the cellular circuitry of the VTA and the NAc, define the sites within these areas at which cannabinoids alter synaptic processes, and discuss the relevance of these actions to the regulation of reinforcement and reward. In addition, we compare the effects of Delta(9)-THC with those of other commonly abused drugs on these reward circuits, and we discuss the roles that endogenous cannabinoids may play within these brain pathways, and their possible involvement in regulating ongoing brain function, independently of marijuana consumption. We conclude that, whereas Delta(9)-THC alters the activity of these central reward pathways in a manner that is consistent with other abused drugs, the cellular mechanism through which this occurs is likely different, relying upon the combined regulation of several afferent pathways to the VTA.}},

To ascertain whether CB(1) mRNA was a marker for striatal efferents, digoxigenin-labeled probes for mRNA markers of both striatonigral (prodynorphin or preprotachykinin A mRNAs), and striatopallidal (proenkephalin mRNAs) projection neurons were combined with the (35)S-labeled probe for CB(1). A mediolateral gradient in CB(1) mRNA expression was observed at rostral and mid-striatal levels; in the same coronal sections the number of silver grains per cell ranged from below the threshold of detectability at the medial and ventral poles to saturation at the dorsolateral boundary bordered by the corpus callosum. At the caudal level examined, CB(1) mRNA was denser in the ventral sector relative to the dorsal sector. Virtually all neurons expressing mRNA markers for striatal projection neurons colocalized CB(1) mRNA. Combining a (35)S-labeled riboprobe for CB(1) with digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes for both preproenkephalin and prodynorphin confirmed localization of CB(1) mRNA to striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons expressing prodynorphin and preproenkephalin mRNAs, respectively. However, CB(1) mRNA-positive cells that failed to coexpress the other markers were also apparent. CB(1) mRNA was localized to putative GABAergic interneurons that express high levels of GAD67 mRNA.

By contrast, aspiny interneurons that express preprosomatostatin mRNA and cholinergic interneurons that coexpress ChAT and VAChT mRNAs were CB(1) mRNA-negative. The present data provide direct evidence that cannabinoid receptors are synthesized in striatonigral neurons that contain dynorphin and substance P and striatopallidal neurons that contain enkephalin.

To investigate the possible mechanisms through which CB receptors may modulate GABAergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus, whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were performed on CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat brain slices. Stimulus-evoked GABA(A) receptor-mediated IPSCs were reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by the CB receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2 (EC(50) of 138 nM). This effect was blocked by the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A (1 microM) but not by the opioid antagonist naloxone. In contrast, evoked GABA(B)-mediated IPSCs were insensitive to the CB agonist. WIN 55,212-2 also reduced the frequency of spontaneous, action potential-dependent IPSCs (sIPSCs), without altering action potential-independent miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs), measured while sodium channels were blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX). Blockade of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) by cadmium also eliminated the effect of WIN 55,212-2 on sIPSCs. Depolarization of inhibitory terminals with elevated extracellular potassium caused a large increase in the frequency of mIPSCs that was inhibited by both cadmium and WIN 55,212-2. The presynaptic effect of WIN 55,212-2 was also investigated using the potassium channel blockers barium and 4-aminopyridine. Neither of these agents significantly altered the effect of WIN 55,212-2 on evoked IPSCs. Together, these data suggest that presynaptic CB1 receptors reduce GABA(A)- but not GABA(B)-mediated synaptic inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons by inhibiting VDCCs located on inhibitory nerve terminals.}},

However, the VTA projection to the PFC also contains a substantial nondopamine component, whose neurochemical phenotype is unknown. To examine if a portion of this nondopamine VTA projection contains GABA, anterograde and retrograde tract-tracing in the rat was combined with GABA immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy. Following injections of Fluoro-Gold (FG) into the PFC, many VTA neurons were retrogradely labeled, as visualized by immunoperoxidase staining for FG. A large portion of FG-labeled somata (58\%) and dendrites (33\%) within the VTA also contained immunogold-silver labeling for GABA. These dually labeled profiles exhibited a morphology similar to dopamine-containing cells within the VTA. To confirm and extend these findings, anterograde transport of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) from the VTA was combined with immunogold-silver labeling for GABA within the PFC. Consistent with the results obtained from retrograde tracing, a portion of BDA-labeled terminals in the PFC also contained immunoreactivity for GABA. These dually labeled terminals formed symmetric synapses onto small caliber dendrites and dendritic spines. Some PFC dendrites contacted by GABA-containing VTA terminals were themselves GABA-labeled. The results of this investigation have identified a substantial population of GABA-containing neurons in the VTA that send axons to the PFC where they synapse on the distal processes of both pyramidal and local circuit neurons. This GABA-containing mesocortical pathway may provide substrates for both inhibitory and disinhibitory influences on PFC neuronal activity.}},

These non-DA neurons were activated both antidromically and orthodromically by stimulation of the internal capsule (IC; conduction velocity, 2.4 +/- 0.2 m/sec; refractory period, 0.6 +/- 0.1 msec) and were inhibited by stimulation of the nucleus accumbens septi (NAcc). Their firing rate was moderately reduced, and their IC-driven activity was suppressed by microelectrophoretic application or systemic administration of NMDA receptor antagonists. VTA non-DA neurons were recorded intracellularly and showed relatively depolarized resting membrane potentials (-61.9 +/- 1.8 mV) and small action potentials (68.3 +/- 2.1 mV). They were injected with neurobiotin and shown by light microscopic immunocytochemistry to be multipolar cells and by electron microscopy to contain GABA but not the catecholamine-synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Neurobiotin-filled dendrites containing GABA received asymmetric excitatory-type synapses from unlabeled terminals and symmetric synapses from terminals that also contained GABA.

The parabrachial nuclei (PBN) integrate information from visceral and gustatory afferents.

In two experiments, a total of 19 rats were given ibotenic acid or electrolytic lesions targeted at the PBN. The PBN-lesioned animals showed a marked attenuation in anticipatory approaches to the food bin relative to sham-operated controls. Some animals did not anticipate the meal at all.

Following injections of Lucifer yellow and horse radish peroxidase into the medial ventral striatum, there is a very densely labeled distribution of cells in areas 13a and 13b, primarily in layers V and VI, and in medial prefrontal areas 32 and 25. Injections into the shell of the nucleus accumbens labeled primarily areas 25 and 32.

These results demonstrate that the orbital prefrontal cortex projects primarily to the medial edge of the ventral striatum and to the core of the nucleus accumbens. The arrangement of terminals in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra show two different patterns.

	abstract = {{Although interference with dopamine (DA) systems can suppress lever pressing for food reinforcement, it is not clear whether this effect occurs because of a general disruption of food motivation. One way of assessing this has been a choice procedure in which a rat responds on an fixed ratio 5 (FR5) schedule for preferred Bioserve pellets while a less preferred lab chow is concurrently available in the operant chamber. Untreated rats consume little of the chow, preferring to respond for the Bioserve pellets. Previous studies have shown that depleting DA in the accumbens substantially decreased lever pressing while increasing chow consumption. In the present study, low doses (0.0625-1.0 microg) of the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 or the D2 antagonist raclopride were injected into the either the core or shell subregions of nucleus accumbens, and rats were tested on the concurrent lever pressing/feeding task. Analysis of the dose response curves showed that injections of SCH 23390 into the core were more potent than injections into the shell for suppressing lever pressing (i.e., the ED(50) was lower in the core). Nevertheless, injections of either drug into either site suppressed lever pressing and increased intake of the concurrently available chow. Across both drugs and at both sites, the amount of chow consumed was negatively correlated with the total number of responses. Neither drug significantly increased response duration, suggesting that accumbens DA antagonism did not produce the type of motor impairment that leads to severe alterations in the form of lever pressing. In summary, the blockade of D1 or D2 receptors in nucleus accumbens core or shell decreased lever pressing for food reinforcers, but rats remained directed toward the acquisition and consumption of food. These results indicate that accumbens D1 antagonism does not decrease lever pressing because of a general reduction in food motivation. Nevertheless, interference with accumbens DA does appear to set constraints upon which responses are selected for obtaining food, and may impair the ability of animals to overcome work-related response costs in order to obtain food.}},
