	abstract = "Using the approach of bounded rationality and myopic learning, we attempt to explain why bees (as examples of a forager animal) do the right (optimal) thing in an environment of many foragers, namely to adopt the Ideal Free Distribution, but do the wrong thing when they are alone, namely stick to the Matching Law. We discuss two types of simple foraging strategies for bees. Each of these explicit strategies explains that in a multi-bee community the bees will distribute themselves over the nectar sources according to the Ideal Free Distribution. At the same time, these strategies explain that in single-bee experimental settings a bee will match, by its number of visits, the nectar supply from the available sources (the Matching Law). Moreover, both strategies explain that in certain situations the bees may behave as if they are risk averse. These results indicate that a competitive market in a multi-bee community permits individuals to be boundedly rational and still forage optimally. � 1995 Academic Press Limited 1."

We show that the resulting IFD is a Nash equilibrium and an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). Moreover, we show that for a certain cost function it is a global optimum point. We introduce the {\grqq}replicator dynamics ” for the IFD and show that we provide an allocation strategy that is guaranteed to achieve the IFD. Finally, we show how this allocation strategy can achieve an IFD for a multizone temperature control problem that corresponds to achieving the maximum uniform temperature on a grid under a multivariable saturation constraint."

	abstract = "This paper introduces a mathematical model of the behavior of a group of agents and their interactions in a shared environment. We represent environmental spatial constraints that allow us to model range-limited sensing, motion, and communication capabilities of the agents. We derive general sensing, coordination, and motion conditions on the agents that guarantee that an {\grqq}ideal free distribution” (IFD) of the group of agents will emerge across the environment. We show the impact of group size on the distribution of agents, and consider the emergent distribution for different classes of environments. Finally, we show how this theory is useful in solving a multi-vehicle cooperative surveillance problem."

This view of bacteriology is now recognized to be overly simplistic, because bacteria communicate with each other through small {\grqq}hormone-like” organic compounds referred to as autoinducers. These bacterial cell-to-cell signaling systems were initially described as mechanisms through which bacteria regulate gene expression via cell density and, therefore, they have been collectively termed quorum sensing. The functions controlled by quorum sensing are varied and reflect the needs of a particular species of bacteria to inhabit a given niche. Three major quorum-sensing circuits have been described: one used primarily by Gram-negative bacteria, one used primarily by Gram-positive bacteria, and one that has been proposed to be universal.",

We show that both polling and contagion processes often end up in herding behaviour, with most agents taking uniformly either one view or the other, even in disordered systems. In the parameter transition regime, the outcome of the dynamical process depends on the precise instanciation of disorder. For instance, when agents face a ternary choice between similar products A and B with the possibility of taking none, the initial distribution of early buyers drastically influences the outcome of the selection process."
