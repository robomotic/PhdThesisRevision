Firstly, I would like to express the deepest gratitude to my supervisor
Dr. Bernd Porr for giving me the opportunity to do a PhD in the field
 of computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence.
Secondly, I would like to thank Maria Thompson for being a
a science colleague with good critical thinking and Lynsey A. McCabe, the warmest Scottish
person I have ever met in Glasgow.
I have enjoyed the company of many other PhD students who shared the good and bad turns of
my life: a nice hug to Colin Waddel, Mohammad AlRawani and the like.

A special mention to the laboratory technician, Tom O'Hara who
helped me with many matters, from every day life problems to the
boring technical issues of lab demonstrations.

I hope the new rookies in my office will have an exciting career and live
up to the standards of our group.

The financial support for this research project, given by the Scottish Funding Council
in the name of Glasgow Research Partnership in Engineering (GRPE) is gratefully
acknowledged.

I would also like to thank the Scottish Enterprise, the Scottish Gateway, the PSBYT and
the student Enterprise, in particular Greig Sinclair, for their support in taking
forward my business idea and giving me the opportunity to learn more about
entrepreneurship.

Finally a big thanks to my girlfriend Pi Yi Wei who supported me in endless
sessions of late night writing and horrible time tables.
