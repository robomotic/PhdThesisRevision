\section*{Abstract}
\begin{minipage}[center]{1.0\textwidth}
This thesis develops a theoretical framework necessary to reproduce the 
complexity of human like societies.

This novel theoretical framework integrates the autopoietic hypothesis of human
societies, formulated originally by the German sociologist Luhmann, with concepts
of Shannon's information theory applied to adaptive learning agents\nomenclature{Agent}{An autonomous intelligent unit
able to cooperate with others and interact with the environment}.

Simulation were done by using Multi-Agent-Based Modelling (ABM\nomenclature{ABM}{Agent Based Modelling}), 
a relatively new computational modelling paradigm involving 
the modelling of phenomena as dynamical systems of interacting agents. 
The thesis in particular, investigates the functions and properties necessary to 
reproduce the paradigm of society by using the mentioned ABM approach.

Luhmann has proposed that in society subsystems are formed to reduce
uncertainty. 
Subsystems can then be composed by agents with a reduced behavioural complexity.
For example in society there are people who produce goods and other who
distribute them. 

The thesis shows that sub-systems emerge when the
agents are able to learn and have the ability to communicate.
Both the behaviour and communication is learned by the agent and not imposed.
The simulated task is to collect food, keep it and eat it until
sated. Every agent communicates its energy state to the neighbouring agents.
This results in two subsystems whereas agents in the first collect food and in
the latter steal food from others. The ratio between the number of agents that
belongs to the first system and to the second system, depends on the number of
food resources.
Simulations are in accordance with Luhmann, who 
suggested that adaptive agents self-organise by reducing the amount of sensory 
information or, equivalently, reducing the complexity of the
perceived environment from the agent's perspective. 
Shannon's information is used to assess the performance of the simulated learning
agents.
A practical measure, based on the concept of Shannon's information flow, 
is developed and applied to adaptive controllers which use Hebbian learning, input
correlation learning (ICO\nomenclature{ICO}{Input Correlation Only
learning}/ISO\nomenclature{ISO}{Isotropic Sequence Order learning}) and
temporal difference learning.
The behavioural complexity 
is measured with a novel information measure, called Predictive Performance, which 
is able to measure at a subjective level how good an agent is performing a task.
This is then used to quantify the social division of tasks in a social group of 
honest, cooperative food foraging, communicating agents.
